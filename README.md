# HackerTracker Web

HackerTracker Web is the web-based interface for the HackerTracker mobile applications. For mobile versions, check out the [Android](https://github.com/junctor/android) and [iOS](https://github.com/junctor/hackertracker) repositories.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version 14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version 6 or later)

### Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the server on \`localhost:3000\` by default.

### Building for Production

To build and export the site as static HTML for production, use:

```bash
npm run export
```

The static HTML files will be generated in the \`docs\` directory. For more details, see the [Next.js static export documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports).

### Deployment

For information on deploying a static-only Next.js application, refer to the [official Next.js deployment guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying#static-only).

### Usage

After setting up the development environment, you can access the web interface at `localhost:3000`. Use the navigation menu to explore different sections such as events, schedules, and more.
