Many tools exist for encrypting online communications and keeping your data private. However, many people don't know that they need these tools or how to access them. The Calyx Institute will continue to develop these tools and educate the public on the best ways to use them, with the goal of making cybersecurity, privacy, and freedom of expression accessible to everyone. Through research and development, legal advocacy and defense, and by distributing information and open-source software as widely as possible for the benefit of the general public in both democratic and repressive contexts, they hope to build a more free and accessible Internet.  \r\n  \r\nwebsite: https://calyxinstitute.org/","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720155420,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54319,54386,54425],"conference_id":145,"event_ids":[54761,54798,54696],"name":"Calyx Institute","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":53946}],"timeband_id":1179,"links":[],"end":"2024-07-14T16:00:00.000-0000","id":54798,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[46498,46503],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1720971000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46505,"sort_order":1,"person_id":53946},{"tag_id":46471,"sort_order":1,"person_id":53946}],"tags":"","conference_id":145,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"Marillac Terrace (Village Area) ONGOING","hotel":"","short_name":"Marillac Terrace (Village Area) ONGOING","id":46394},"begin":"2024-07-14T15:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-05T04:57:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"HOPE2024","timezone":"America/New_York","link":"","description":"If you own a HOPE electronic badge or other similar device, then celebrate by coming to The Badge Clinic with your stories, questions, and answers.

Attendees will leave this presentation with an understanding of how to integrate voice cloning into their social engineering toolkit and enhance the realism and success rate of their penetration tests.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720155420,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54272],"conference_id":145,"event_ids":[54654],"name":"XaiL","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":53899},{"content_ids":[54272],"conference_id":145,"event_ids":[54654],"name":"SecuritySean","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54037}],"timeband_id":1177,"links":[],"end":"2024-07-13T00:50:00.000-0000","id":54654,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[46497,46502],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1720828800,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46471,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54037},{"tag_id":46505,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54037},{"tag_id":46471,"sort_order":1,"person_id":53899},{"tag_id":46505,"sort_order":1,"person_id":53899}],"tags":"","conference_id":145,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"Tobin 201/202","hotel":"","short_name":"Tobin 201/202","id":46384},"begin":"2024-07-13T00:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-05T04:57:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"HOPE2024","timezone":"America/New_York","link":"","description":"Our medical aids (DME, or Durable Medical Equipment) are designed with planned obsolescence, closed-source, and perhaps most importantly, without our input.

Although many backdoor attacks limit the attack surface to the model, ML models are not standalone objects. Instead, they are artifacts built using a wide range of tools and embedded into pipelines with many interacting components. In this talk, Suha will introduce incubated ML exploits in which attackers inject model backdoors into ML pipelines using input-handling bugs in ML tools. Using a language-theoretic security (LangSec) framework, they systematically exploited ML model serialization bugs in popular tools to construct backdoors. In the process, they developed malicious artifacts such as polyglot and ambiguous files using ML model files. The team also contributed to Fickling, a pickle security tool tailored for ML use cases. Finally, they formulated a set of guidelines for security researchers and ML practitioners. By chaining system security issues and model vulnerabilities, incubated ML exploits emerge as a new class of exploits that highlight the importance of a holistic approach to ML security.","title":"Incubated Machine Learning Exploits: Backdooring ML Pipelines Using Input-Handling Bugs","type":{"conference_id":145,"conference":"HOPE2024","updated_at":"2024-07-13T19:05+0000","color":"#3bcbbf","name":"Talk","id":46502},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1720817400,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Machine learning (ML) pipelines are vulnerable to model backdoors that compromise the integrity of the underlying system.
