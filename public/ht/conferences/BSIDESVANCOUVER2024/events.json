The Infostealers (Lumma, RedLine, RisePro, Amadey, Stealc) exfilterated various sensitive information before the ransomware encrypted the files. The Proxy Bot malware (Socks5Systemz) transformed the system into a proxy bot, and the Ransomware (STOP) encrypted the files, demanding a ransom for their recovery.

Code patterns are abstracted into language specific queries that can be used to scan across many repositories for QA, research, and variant hunt purposes with the option to integrate as part of your CI/CD pipeline. CodeQL is powerful and extensible, with many included queries as well as a query language that allows a query author to write their own. In this workshop we’ll write queries for three C# vulnerabilities: BinaryFormatter deserialization of untrusted data, use of the weak hash SHA1, and creation of a Weak RSA Key.
