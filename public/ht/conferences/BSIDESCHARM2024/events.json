Each trait boasts a 0-5 score, fueling the DRS calculation, enabling decisive action, and erasing uncertainty.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1713646200,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1712084940,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"conference_id":137,"event_ids":[54259],"name":"Dana Behling","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":53554}],"timeband_id":1157,"links":[],"end":"2024-04-20T20:50:00.000-0000","id":54259,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[46247],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1713643200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46233,"sort_order":1,"person_id":53554}],"tags":"","conference_id":137,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":137,"conference":"BSIDESCHARM2024","updated_at":"2024-04-02T19:16+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"Track 1","hotel":"","short_name":"Track 1","id":46195},"begin":"2024-04-20T20:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-04-02T19:09:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESCHARM2024","timezone":"America/New_York","link":"","description":"In this talk, we’ll discuss the multicloud threat landscape and walk through strategic, process and technical gaps in Identity and Access Management.

Also, studies indicate that a small number of users create most of the losses. One study found that 4% of users cause 80% of damage. As a potential attacker or defender, you clearly want to find those most vulnerable users. The question is, how do we find those 4%? Then how do we either target those users or better secure the organization against them? Attackers, including red teams, perform spear phishing to targets without regard to levels of susceptibility. Defenders don’t differentiate the levels of controls applied to users, which results in wasteful efforts that aggravate otherwise aware users. To identify users highly susceptible to phishing attacks, a study was performed, partially funded by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, where subjects were administered a variety of psychological assessments and were then sent a series of phishing messages over several months. Based upon those phishing messages, user susceptibility was determined. Personality traits of the subjects was then compared to their level of phishing susceptibility. Two traits were indicative of phishing susceptibility; low locus of control and high levels of neuroticism as measured on the Big 5 personality test. Machine learning techniques were then applied to classify phishing susceptibility, with 100% accuracy, based on 5 personality traits: locus of control, depression, self-discipline, communications, and anxiety. While attackers (or even cybersecurity programs) can’t administer psychological assessments, there are social media indicators of these traits. Indicators include, Frequent negative posts, Indications of social isolation, Sleep disturbances as demonstrated by posting at late hours, High levels of personal disclosure, and Posting many selfies. This information is rarely considered in attacks. This presentation defines how to apply psychological profiling of potential targets to refine target lists, and make attacks more likely to be successful.

Our journey takes us through a series of true tales from the front lines of cybersecurity.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1712084940,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"conference_id":137,"event_ids":[54249],"name":"Kevin Johnson","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":53568}],"timeband_id":1157,"links":[],"end":"2024-04-20T16:50:00.000-0000","id":54249,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1713628800,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[46247],"village_id":null,"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46233,"sort_order":1,"person_id":53568}],"tags":"","conference_id":137,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":137,"conference":"BSIDESCHARM2024","updated_at":"2024-04-02T19:16+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"Track 2","hotel":"","short_name":"Track 2","id":46196},"begin":"2024-04-20T16:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-04-02T19:09:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESCHARM2024","timezone":"America/New_York","link":"","description":"We have an Identity problem and not the kind you think of when you look in the mirror.
