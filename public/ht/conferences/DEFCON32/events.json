Se presentarán los mecanismos de descifrado disponibles frente a esta y otras amenazas similares y las técnicas usadas por los adversarios para comprometer las infraestructuras.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722700538,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[55978],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[56594],"name":"Eduardo Chavarro Ovalle","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"","title":"Digital Forensic and Incident Response Group Manager Americas"}],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@echavarro)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://x.com/echavarro"},{"description":"","title":"co.linkedin.com/in/echavarro?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name","sort_order":0,"url":"https://co.linkedin.com/in/echavarro?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name"}],"media":[],"id":56311,"title":"Digital Forensic and Incident Response Group Manager Americas"}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-11T19:00:00Z","timeband_id":1149,"updated_tsz":"2024-08-03T15:55:38Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-11T20:00:00.000-0000","id":56594,"tag_ids":[46405,46511],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723402800,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":2,"person_id":56311}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46252,"name":"LVCC - L2 - W235","hotel":"","short_name":"W235","id":46292},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-11T19:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-08-03T15:55:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Want to create a cute, squishy, Wi-Fi controllable LED cat lamp?

The aim of our E2E OSS is to provide a complete implementation that allows PQ registration and authentication in all protocol operations, to enable developers to experiment and test the viability of PQ cryptography in current hardware devices providing FIDO2 authentication.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722626652,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[55858],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[56445],"name":"Nina Bindel","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":56227},{"content_ids":[55858],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[56445],"name":"James Howe","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":56228}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-11T18:00:00Z","timeband_id":1149,"updated_tsz":"2024-08-02T19:24:12Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-11T18:00:00.000-0000","id":56445,"tag_ids":[46389,46511],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723399200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":2,"person_id":56227},{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":4,"person_id":56228}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46256,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW3-06-01","hotel":"","short_name":"HW3-06-01","id":46270},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-11T18:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-08-02T19:24:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"In this workshop we will build an inexpensive ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast) receiver with a Raspberry Pi and RTL-SDR.

From here, we’ll cover a vulnerability we found in AWS Amplify which exposed IAM roles associated with the service to takeover, allowing anyone the ability to assume these roles.\n\nFinally, we will also look at a worst-case scenario: what happens when an attacker finds a confused deputy vulnerability and is able to assume roles in other accounts?

Players can expect to learn how to make a persuasive argument, and the nature of value in an (often) pay-to-win world that we live in.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722311882,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-11T17:00:00Z","timeband_id":1149,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-30T03:58:02Z","links":[{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/249429"},{"label":"Sub-forum (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/249428"}],"end":"2024-08-11T19:00:00.000-0000","id":56069,"tag_ids":[46427,46439,46750],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723395600,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46257,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW4-02-02-F","hotel":"","short_name":"HW4-02-02-F","id":46367},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-11T17:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-30T03:58:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Adversary Village proudly presents \"Adversary Wars CTF\", an official contest at DEF CON, where the participants will have to pose as adversaries and replicate adversarial actions against each element of a “target” organization.

Your task is to use the available information that your team has at your disposal to stop the adversary from achieving their objective.\r\n\r\nPlayers will find themselves in a variety of future scenarios based on a specific industry/sector focus e.g. manufacturing, utilities, defense, finance. The task will be to defend each individual network/system to govern, identify, detect, respond and recover against abnormal/suspicious activities on the network. You will be working against a global hacker network who are threatening to disrupt the overall operations of global critical infrastructure sites for their own nefarious means.\r\n\r\nYour team must protect various networks/systems as part of a global environment. If 5 or more systems are compromised and deactivated, the hacker network successfully disabled the global environment and can assume control of the entire environment. It is your mission to protect the environment and ensure the availability of the global system.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722310334,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-11T17:00:00Z","timeband_id":1149,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-30T03:32:14Z","links":[{"label":"Sub-forum (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/249384"},{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/249385"}],"end":"2024-08-11T19:00:00.000-0000","id":56038,"tag_ids":[46439,46762],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723395600,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46257,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW4-03-06-C","hotel":"","short_name":"HW4-03-06-C","id":46376},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-11T17:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-30T03:32:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Darknet-NG is an Alternate Reality Game (ARG), where the players take on the Persona of an Agent who is sent on Quests to learn real skills and gain in-game points.

If participants register for this challenge more than once, the whole teams with a participant that registered multiple times will be disqualified.\r\n\r\nBy registering, participants agree that their accounts may be rejected or terminated and all submissions by them and/or their Team may be disqualified if any of the information in their account is incorrect.\r\n\r\nParticipants must agree to and abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://www.villageb.io/code-of-conduct) while participating in the Biohacking Village Capture the Flag. Anyone who will conduct themselves against the CoC will be eliminated from competition and banned forever.\r\n\r\n## TEAMS\r\n\r\nAfter participants register individually, they may work alone (team of one) or on one team with other challenge participants. To work on a team, they may either create a new team or join one that is pre-existing ( if a participant wishes to join a team or offer others to join, they can do so in the #ctf-st-elvis-teambuilding Discord Channel)\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of team members is five (5).\r\n\r\nAll teams must designate a Team Captain. A Team Captain serves as the official contact person for a team: this person should provide accurate and complete contact information to ensure that CTF organizers can reach their team if needed.\r\n\r\nEach member of the team must be a registered participant in the CTF.\r\n\r\nIf participants choose to join a team, then they may not simultaneously participate as an individual or another team. \r\n\r\n## CHALLENGE SUBMISSIONS\r\n\r\nAll submissions must be received during the Challenge period. Submissions posted after the posted time frame will be disqualified.\r\n\r\nParticipants may get an answer but it will forfeit their points for that challenge. Even if the flag they tried before was similar. The decision to get the answer is final for zero points.\r\n\r\n## CHALLENGE SCORING\r\n\r\nEach submission has set value known beforehand in the challenge description\r\n\r\nThe winning teams will be decided based on the number of the accumulated points during the CTF timeframe. In case two teams accumulate the same amount of points, the team that reached the amount of points in question faster will be the winner.\r\n\r\n## CHALLENGE DISQUALIFICATION\r\n\r\nWhole team gets disqualified if any of the following applies:\r\n\r\n - One or multiple team members have registered more than once\r\n - One or multiple team members will not follow [Code of Conduct](https://www.villageb.io/code-of-conduct) (applies to any of the Biohacking village platforms or social media)\r\n - Any offensive behaviour such as attacking the Biohacking Village infrastructure, denial of service, or escaping the boundaries set by the CTF or Device Lab environment\r\n\r\n## PRIVACY\r\n\r\nUnless stated otherwise on the mainsite, we do not share any information about participants with anyone.

You should know loops, if statements, arrays, and functions.)","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722361583,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-11T17:00:00Z","timeband_id":1149,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-30T17:46:23Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-11T18:00:00.000-0000","id":55761,"tag_ids":[46398,46641],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723395600,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46256,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW3-06-03","hotel":"","short_name":"HW3-06-03","id":46271},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-11T17:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-30T17:46:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"ICS/OT environments are targets.

With at least 500k Draytek routers exposed to the Internet globally, no working tools exist to extract their firmware and assist researchers and defenders working with them.\r\n\r\nWe reverse-engineered Draytek's firmware format, developed tools to extract it, and discovered that its RTOS kernel can load code modules dynamically. These stored modules remain active even after firmware upgrades, inadvertently facilitating persistent threats. We crafted and uploaded malicious modules using our tools and newly found vulnerabilities to achieve persistence.\r\n\r\nEnd-users lack straightforward means to detect such compromises. In response to this threat, we developed our own module to assess the integrity of other modules loaded in memory, mitigating its impact.

We faced this firsthand when a client that used Draytek equipment was compromised. With at least 500k Draytek routers exposed to the Internet globally, no working tools exist to extract their firmware and assist researchers and defenders working with them.\r\n\r\nWe reverse-engineered Draytek's firmware format, developed tools to extract it, and discovered that its RTOS kernel can load code modules dynamically. These stored modules remain active even after firmware upgrades, inadvertently facilitating persistent threats. We crafted and uploaded malicious modules using our tools and newly found vulnerabilities to achieve persistence.\r\n\r\nEnd-users lack straightforward means to detect such compromises. In response to this threat, we developed our own module to assess the integrity of other modules loaded in memory, mitigating its impact. In our pursuit of a more secure internet, we are sharing our knowledge and opening our tools to the community, enabling observability, hardening, transparency, and vulnerability research on Draytek edge devices.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720400599,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54642,55974],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[56590,55015],"name":"Octavio Gianatiempo","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"Faraday","title":"Security Researcher"},{"organization":"University of Buenos Aires","title":"Student, Computer Science"}],"pronouns":"he/him","links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/octavio-gianatiempo"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@ogianatiempo)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/ogianatiempo"}],"media":[],"id":54238,"title":"Student, Computer Science at University of Buenos Aires"},{"content_ids":[54642,55974],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[56590,55015],"name":"Gastón Aznarez","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"Faraday","title":"Security Researcher"}],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://linkedin.com/in/gastonaznarez"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@gastonaznarez)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/gastonaznarez"}],"media":[],"id":54239,"title":"Security Researcher at Faraday"}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-11T17:00:00Z","timeband_id":1149,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-08T01:03:19Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-11T18:00:00.000-0000","id":55015,"tag_ids":[46169,46381,46419,46511,46736,46883],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723395600,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Demo 💻","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54239},{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54238}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46255,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW2-07-04 (Creator Stage 1)","hotel":"","short_name":"HW2-07-04 (Creator Stage 1)","id":46340},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-11T17:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-08T01:03:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"As our social lives are highly intertwined with our online lives, people share a lot of information and create pictures and content that needs to be secured.

Please be patient. All of the times listed here are **approximate**. \r\n\r\n# Basics\r\n\r\n### Who needs a badge?\r\n\r\nA badge is required for each human age 8 and older.\r\n\r\n### Human?\r\n\r\nYou are a human if you do not know otherwise. People that are not humans include goons, official speaker, village/community/contest/creator staff, press, black badge holders, or similar. If you are not a human, you need to register separately. If you don't know how, see an NFO goon (NFO Node, formerly known as an infobooth, is where you can get help). The remainder of this message applies only to humans.\r\n\r\n### Lines? Linecon?\r\n\r\nLinecon is your optional opportunity to stand (or sit) in line for human registration to open. Doors will open for linecon on Wednesday at approximately 17:00. When human registration opens on Thursday at approximately 08:00, they start working the linecon queue, and the line will start moving quickly. (Please understand that we will begin processing the line on Thursday morning as soon as the cashiers and materials are in place; we will strive for Thursday 08:00, but actual start may be slightly earlier or later.)\r\n\r\nOnline badge purchase (aka pre-registration) has no impact on linecon. You can join the line on Wednesday (if you wish) regardless of whether you purchased a badge online or intend to pay with cash. There is only one linecon for both types of badge sales. \r\n\r\nPlease help us make this a great experience for everyone by **following directions given by goons**. After human registration opens, there may be one line for all of registration, or there may be two lines (one for online sales (pre-registration) and one for cash sales). This may also change over time, based on available staffing and necessary crowd control. We will strive to make it easily understandable in-person as to which line you should join. \r\n\r\n# Ways to buy a badge\r\n\r\n- $480 [online purchase](https://shop.defcon.org/products/def-con-32-las-vegas-convention-center) until August 1, 2024. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.\r\n- $460 cash purchase on-site.\r\n- As part of a BlackHat registration.\r\n\r\n### Online Purchase\r\n\r\nYou will be emailed a QR code to the email address provided when you bought your badge. Please guard that QR code as though it is cash -- it can only be redeemed once, and anyone can redeem it if they have it (including a photo of it). Badges are picked-up on-site -- they will not be mailed or shipped.\r\n\r\nWe can scan the QR code either from your phone's display or from a printed copy. You **must** have the QR code with you in order to obtain your badge. As you approach the front of the line, if you are going to show your QR code on an electronic device, please ensure that your display is set to maximum brightness. \r\n\r\nIf you pre-registered, but ultimately are unable to attend DEF CON and want to cancel your purchase, the **only** way to get a refund is from the original online source. We are unable to provide any refunds on-site at DEF CON. There is a fee to have your badge canceled: $34 until July 15, and $84 on and after July 15.\r\n\r\nOnline purchases are provided a receipt via email when the purchase is made.\r\n\r\nOnline purchase -- often referred to as pre-registration -- does not allow you to skip any line/queue to pick up your badge. Once you arrive on-site, you will need to join the existing line for human registration. There may or may not be a dedicated line for pre-registration badge pickup, depending on when you arrive, how long the line is, available staff, etc.\r\n\r\n### Cash Purchase\r\n\r\nBadges will be available for purchase on-site at DEF CON. All badge sales are **cash only**. No checks, money orders, credit cards, etc., will be accepted. In order to keep the registration line moving as quickly as possible, please have **exact change** ready as you near the front of the line.\r\n\r\nThere are no refunds given for cash sales. If you have any doubt about your desire to buy a badge, please refrain from doing so.\r\n\r\nWe are unable to provide printed receipts at the time of the sale. A generic receipt for the cash sale of a badge will be made available on media.defcon.org after the conference. You are welcome to print your own copy of the receipt on plain paper.\r\n\r\n### Via BlackHat \r\n\r\nIf you attend BlackHat, it is possible to purchase a DEF CON badge with your BlackHat registration. If you did so, please get your DEF CON badge from BlackHat before they close. \r\n\r\nBlackHat should send you an email with instructions for how to obtain your DEF CON badge. In case you missed it, you can go to the second floor, at the concierge desk, halfway down Black Hat Blvd.\r\n\r\n# Misc\r\n\r\nWant to buy multiple badges? No problem! We're happy to sell you however many badges you want to pay for.\r\n\r\nIf you lose your badge, there is unfortunately no way for us to replace it. You'll have to buy a replacement at full price. Please don't lose your badge. :( \r\n\r\nIf you are being accompanied by a full-time caretaker (such as someone who will push your wheelchair, and will accompany you at all times), please ask to speak to a Registration Goon.

All of the times listed here are **approximate**. \r\n\r\n# Basics\r\n\r\n### Who needs a badge?\r\n\r\nA badge is required for each human age 8 and older.\r\n\r\n### Human?\r\n\r\nYou are a human if you do not know otherwise. People that are not humans include goons, official speaker, village/community/contest/creator staff, press, black badge holders, or similar. If you are not a human, you need to register separately. If you don't know how, see an NFO goon (NFO Node, formerly known as an infobooth, is where you can get help). The remainder of this message applies only to humans.\r\n\r\n### Lines? Linecon?\r\n\r\nLinecon is your optional opportunity to stand (or sit) in line for human registration to open. Doors will open for linecon on Wednesday at approximately 17:00. When human registration opens on Thursday at approximately 08:00, they start working the linecon queue, and the line will start moving quickly. (Please understand that we will begin processing the line on Thursday morning as soon as the cashiers and materials are in place; we will strive for Thursday 08:00, but actual start may be slightly earlier or later.)\r\n\r\nOnline badge purchase (aka pre-registration) has no impact on linecon. You can join the line on Wednesday (if you wish) regardless of whether you purchased a badge online or intend to pay with cash. There is only one linecon for both types of badge sales. \r\n\r\nPlease help us make this a great experience for everyone by **following directions given by goons**. After human registration opens, there may be one line for all of registration, or there may be two lines (one for online sales (pre-registration) and one for cash sales). This may also change over time, based on available staffing and necessary crowd control. We will strive to make it easily understandable in-person as to which line you should join. \r\n\r\n# Ways to buy a badge\r\n\r\n- $480 [online purchase](https://shop.defcon.org/products/def-con-32-las-vegas-convention-center) until August 1, 2024. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.\r\n- $460 cash purchase on-site.\r\n- As part of a BlackHat registration.\r\n\r\n### Online Purchase\r\n\r\nYou will be emailed a QR code to the email address provided when you bought your badge. Please guard that QR code as though it is cash -- it can only be redeemed once, and anyone can redeem it if they have it (including a photo of it). Badges are picked-up on-site -- they will not be mailed or shipped.\r\n\r\nWe can scan the QR code either from your phone's display or from a printed copy. You **must** have the QR code with you in order to obtain your badge. As you approach the front of the line, if you are going to show your QR code on an electronic device, please ensure that your display is set to maximum brightness. \r\n\r\nIf you pre-registered, but ultimately are unable to attend DEF CON and want to cancel your purchase, the **only** way to get a refund is from the original online source. We are unable to provide any refunds on-site at DEF CON. There is a fee to have your badge canceled: $34 until July 15, and $84 on and after July 15.\r\n\r\nOnline purchases are provided a receipt via email when the purchase is made.\r\n\r\nOnline purchase -- often referred to as pre-registration -- does not allow you to skip any line/queue to pick up your badge. Once you arrive on-site, you will need to join the existing line for human registration. There may or may not be a dedicated line for pre-registration badge pickup, depending on when you arrive, how long the line is, available staff, etc.\r\n\r\n### Cash Purchase\r\n\r\nBadges will be available for purchase on-site at DEF CON. All badge sales are **cash only**. No checks, money orders, credit cards, etc., will be accepted. In order to keep the registration line moving as quickly as possible, please have **exact change** ready as you near the front of the line.\r\n\r\nThere are no refunds given for cash sales. If you have any doubt about your desire to buy a badge, please refrain from doing so.\r\n\r\nWe are unable to provide printed receipts at the time of the sale. A generic receipt for the cash sale of a badge will be made available on media.defcon.org after the conference. You are welcome to print your own copy of the receipt on plain paper.\r\n\r\n### Via BlackHat \r\n\r\nIf you attend BlackHat, it is possible to purchase a DEF CON badge with your BlackHat registration. If you did so, please get your DEF CON badge from BlackHat before they close. \r\n\r\nBlackHat should send you an email with instructions for how to obtain your DEF CON badge. In case you missed it, you can go to the second floor, at the concierge desk, halfway down Black Hat Blvd.\r\n\r\n# Misc\r\n\r\nWant to buy multiple badges? No problem! We're happy to sell you however many badges you want to pay for.\r\n\r\nIf you lose your badge, there is unfortunately no way for us to replace it. You'll have to buy a replacement at full price. Please don't lose your badge. :( \r\n\r\nIf you are being accompanied by a full-time caretaker (such as someone who will push your wheelchair, and will accompany you at all times), please ask to speak to a Registration Goon. Your caretaker will receive a paper badge that will permit them to accompany you everywhere you go.\r\n\r\n# Still need help?\r\n\r\nIf you have questions about anything regarding human registration that are not addressed here, please ask to speak to a Registration Goon.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722991207,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-11T15:00:00Z","timeband_id":1149,"updated_tsz":"2024-08-07T00:40:07Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-11T23:00:00.000-0000","id":54481,"tag_ids":[46362],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723388400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"LVCC West Hall","hotel":"","short_name":"LVCC West","id":46180},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-11T15:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-08-07T00:40:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday: 05:00 to 08:00, with random pop up meetings throughout the day in the con space.\r\n\r\nDefcon.run is an evolution of the now long running DEF CON 4x5K running event.

In this presentation, we report on our security findings from our reverse-engineering efforts to exploit VSAT satellite modems from the Earth. We will focus on the Newtec MDM2200 from iDirect as an example. First, we explain how we reverse-engineered the software stack running on the modem device to find 0-day vulnerabilities. Then, we show how we reverse-engineered the network stack to devise attacks that can be launched by injecting wireless signals through the antenna dish of a VSAT terminal. Finally, we demonstrate our software-defined radio end-to-end attacks to inject bogus firmware updates and to gain a remote root shell access on the modem. To the best of knowledge, this represents the first successful demonstration of signal injection attacks on VSAT modems using software-defined radios from the Earth, while previous attacks on VSAT systems such as the ViaSat hack in 2022 were based on exploiting the operator’s network through Internet VPN connections. Our work therefore enlarges significantly the attack surface of VSAT systems.\n\nOur presentation at DEF CON is part of a project that has three parts. \n\nIn the first part, we focus on the inherent security issues in current VSAT system practices.

In the case of software, we might reverse engineer an application's attack surfaces for untrusted input, aiming to trigger edge cases. For websites, we might enumerate a domain for related assets and seek out unpatched, less defended, or occasionally abandoned resources.\r\n\r\nThis presentation explores the untapped potential of scaling security research by leveraging unconventional data sources. We'll walk through design flaws that enable two examples: forgotten cloud assets and leaked secrets. Instead of starting with a target and finding vulnerabilities, we'll find vulnerabilities and relate them to our targets. We won't just stop at discovery.

In the case of software, we might reverse engineer an application's attack surfaces for untrusted input, aiming to trigger edge cases. For websites, we might enumerate a domain for related assets and seek out unpatched, less defended, or occasionally abandoned resources.\r\n\r\nThis presentation explores the untapped potential of scaling security research by leveraging unconventional data sources. We'll walk through design flaws that enable two examples: forgotten cloud assets and leaked secrets. Instead of starting with a target and finding vulnerabilities, we'll find vulnerabilities and relate them to our targets. We won't just stop at discovery. We'll also discuss the incentives that create them and how to solve the ecosystem issues as an industry.\r\n\r\nWhile you can't easily scale every issue, this project has led to tens of thousands of highly significant yet seemingly trivial weaknesses in some of the world's largest organizations.

This work aspires to inspire deep reflection and advancement in the research and development of security technologies that are always several steps ahead of adversaries.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720378486,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54505],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54878],"name":"Helvio Carvalho Junior","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"Sec4US","title":"CEO"}],"pronouns":"he/him","links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/helviojunior/"},{"description":"","title":"sec4us.com.br/","sort_order":0,"url":"https://sec4us.com.br/"},{"description":"","title":"www.helviojunior.com.br/","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.helviojunior.com.br/"}],"media":[],"id":54134,"title":"CEO at Sec4US"}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-10T22:30:00Z","timeband_id":1148,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-07T18:54:46Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-10T23:15:00.000-0000","id":54878,"tag_ids":[46166,46169,46419,46437,46438,46879],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723329000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Demo 💻, Exploit 🪲, Tool 🛠","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54134}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46254,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW1-11-02 (Track 2)","hotel":"","short_name":"HW1-11-02 (Track 2)","id":46301},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-10T22:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-07T18:54:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Since the first car hit the road, manufacturers have been obsessed with safety.

Join us as we explore the possibilities and implications of AI as an offensive assistant in this new era of offensive security.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720331870,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54619],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54993],"name":"Joel \"Niemand_Sec\" Noguera","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"XBOW","title":"Security Researcher"}],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@niemand_sec)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/niemand_sec"}],"media":[],"id":54269,"title":"Security Researcher at XBOW"},{"content_ids":[54619],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54993],"name":"Diego Jurado","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"XBOW","title":"Security Researcher"}],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@djurado9)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/djurado9"}],"media":[],"id":54329,"title":"Security Researcher at XBOW"}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-10T21:30:00Z","timeband_id":1148,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-07T05:57:50Z","links":[{"label":"More Info","type":"link","url":"https://www.bugbountydefcon.com/presentations#leveraging-ai-for-smarter-bug-bounties"}],"end":"2024-08-10T22:15:00.000-0000","id":54993,"tag_ids":[46374,46419,46442,46511,46736,46886],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723325400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":2,"person_id":54329},{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":4,"person_id":54269}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46252,"name":"LVCC - L2 - W222 (Creator Stage 4)","hotel":"","short_name":"W222 (Creator Stage 4)","id":46313},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-10T21:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-07T05:57:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Trolls cheating in video games by passing Tool-Assisted Speedruns off as human effort break leaderboards and stifle speedrunners.

Additionally, we will discuss novel vulnerabilities found in Google Chrome that aided our exploitation of the 1Password browser extension.\r\n\r\nDarthNull’s work around decrypting 1Password vaults: [link](https://darthnull.org/1pass-roundtrip/)","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720463270,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54497],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54870],"name":"Colby Morgan","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"Robinhood","title":"Leads, Pentest Team"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54162,"title":"Leads, Pentest Team at Robinhood"},{"content_ids":[54497],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54870],"name":"Jeffrey Hofmann","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"","title":"Senior Offensive Security Engineer"}],"pronouns":"he/him","links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@jeffssh)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/jeffssh"},{"description":"","title":"Website","sort_order":0,"url":"https://jeffs.sh/"}],"media":[],"id":54163,"title":"Senior Offensive Security Engineer"}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-10T21:00:00Z","timeband_id":1148,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-08T18:27:50Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-10T21:45:00.000-0000","id":54870,"tag_ids":[46166,46169,46419,46437,46438,46881],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723323600,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Demo 💻, Exploit 🪲, Tool 🛠","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":2,"person_id":54163},{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":4,"person_id":54162}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46254,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW1-11-04 (Track 4)","hotel":"","short_name":"HW1-11-04 (Track 4)","id":46319},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-10T21:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-08T18:27:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"SQL injections seem to be a solved problem; databases even have built-in support for prepared statements, leaving no room for injections.

Commercial solutions exist, however these all require monthly subscriptions and cell coverage in order to work.  We are hackers!

This new talk, building on details from his recent book DARK WIRE, will include never-before-published technical details on how the Anom network functioned, how the backdoor itself worked, and how Anom grew to such a size that the FBI started to lose control of its own creation. \r\n\r\nIt will also reflect on how police have entered a new phase of compromising entire encrypted phone networks, with little to no debate from the public, and provide critical insight on what really happens when authorities introduce a backdoor into a telecommunications product.\r\n\r\nDARK WIRE: The Incredible True Story of the Largest Sting Operation Ever, June 4th, 2024: [link](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/joseph-cox/dark-wire/9781541702691/?lens=publicaffairs)","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720463339,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54493,56001],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[56623,54866],"name":"Joseph Cox","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"","title":"Investigative Journalist"},{"organization":"404 Media","title":"Co-Founder"}],"pronouns":"he/him","links":[{"description":"","title":"Bsky","sort_order":0,"url":"https://bsky.app/profile/josephcox.bsky.social"},{"description":"","title":"Mastodon (@josephcox@infosec.exchange)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://infosec.exchange/@josephcox"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@josephfcox)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/josephfcox"}],"media":[],"id":54153,"title":"Co-Founder at 404 Media"}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-10T20:00:00Z","timeband_id":1148,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-08T18:28:59Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-10T20:45:00.000-0000","id":54866,"tag_ids":[46166,46419,46882],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723320000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54153}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46253,"name":"LVCC - L3 - W322-W327 (Warstories Track)","hotel":"","short_name":"W322-W327 (Warstories Track)","id":46314},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-10T20:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-08T18:28:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"The world increasingly appreciates how much we rely on space systems for our personal, economic, and national security needs.

Any mentions of vendors (for CTI content) is solely for the purpose of using a research paper resource that is free to the public, and are not meant to advertise.\r\n\r\nWith an interactive session, participants will learn how: (not in this particular order)\r\n* To choose a threat/actor who is relevant to their organization\r\n* I will have a premade scenario and example ready for participants to follow along\r\n* Setting High-Level Goals for their campaign\r\n* Map their threat/actor to MITRE ATT&CK\r\n** Overview of ATT&CK\r\n\r\n* Simulation Vs Emulation\r\n** how this impacts choosing content\r\n** Combining multiple threats to create a campaign\r\n\r\n* The Power of CTI: Explore completely free CTI resources\r\n** will cover at least 4\r\n** explore already published campaign content\r\n** Interactive Questions & Answers: Making content choices\r\n*** Ex: Is X or Y a better test case for this situation?\r\n** Create multiple layers in ATT&CK navigator, to build their campaign\r\n** Add in open-source content, such as Atomic-Red-Team\r\n*** Quick Demo & interactive: how to find the right Atomic Content\r\n\r\n* Finalizing the Campaign\r\n* Overview of manual options and using open-source tools for executing campaigns\r\n\r\nOther High-level topics that will be presented: (not in this particular order)\r\n* Why create your own content if there is none available\r\n** Your org is in the beginning stages of adopting this strategy, and you want to find\r\na good place to start\r\n** Demonstrate Value (KPIs)\r\n** Budget: org cant onboard BAS/Simulator tools\r\n** You have a BAS but the content isn't there for a specific threat OR its not\r\ncomprehensive enough\r\n* Why focus on a threat actor's TTPs\r\n** Remediations are focused on the type of attack, not a specific indicator\r\n* Adopting Threats for your organization\r\n** Following a framework inspired by MITRE\r\n** Accepting specific threats/actors as likely to target\r\n* Avoiding Technical Bias when choosing test cases\r\n** particularly challenging for engineers who create detections, or work with EDR\r\nsolutions.\r\n\r\n* Make zero assumptions of whether or not a test case will get stopped/logged\r\n** Most important to choose the most aligned content to your threat/actor's TTPs\r\n* Convincing Benefits\r\n** Detection Validation Strategies: High Level Overview(SIEM, EDR, DLP, ect)\r\n** SOC/IR gets to see examples of a full attack chain for specific threat\r\n** Detection engineering gets to understand logging/EDR/tool gaps\r\n** Threat Hunting benefits from both of these insights\r\n* List of Free Resources to dive more into these topics\n\n\nPremise:\r\n* Organizations are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of understanding the\r\nTTPs of the threats/actors most likely to target them.\r\n* Many organizations cannot afford outside consultants, or the ability to maintain a\r\ndedicated internal offensive team. Or they want this style of testing, but don't know how\r\nto get started, or show leadership the value.\r\n* This talk is for any engineer or team leader who wants to bring Adversarial\r\nEmulation/Simulation to their organization to understand how they compare against an\r\nattack from a likely threat. It is also valuable for consultants who want to provide this\r\nservice to their clients.\r\n* If someone is new to offensive techniques, this will be a way for them to think about how this strategy applies to their role, and embrace it as a defensive strategy.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this presentation is to get the participants comfortable with breaking down CTI,\r\nmapping those insights to MITRE, and creating a campaign that will bring value to their work.\r\nEverything is completely focused on post-exploitation TTPs, and their importance. We will not\r\nreview how to integrate IoCs into the mapping of threats. Participants will walk away with a full\r\nexample of the process, resources to explore later, and examples for thinking critically about\r\ntest cases.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722462516,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[55758],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[56283],"name":"Noah Lazzaro","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":56170}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-10T19:30:00Z","timeband_id":1148,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-31T21:48:36Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-10T20:30:00.000-0000","id":56283,"tag_ids":[46373,46511],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723318200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":1,"person_id":56170}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46253,"name":"LVCC - L3 - W310 (BTV Track 1 Presentations)","hotel":"","short_name":"W310 (BTV Track 1 Presentations)","id":46472},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-10T19:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-31T21:48:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"This workshop offers a hands-on introduction to developing Osquery extensions for Linux and macOS, aimed at beginners seeking to enhance endpoint security visibility.

We know about position spoofing, that's a given. What doesn't appear to be getting much attention is the effect of time spoofing.\n\nThe most significant of these is an incident where time was spoofed a significant period into the future. This caused all digital certificates on board an aircraft to become invalid and caused all electronic communications to fail.

We know about position spoofing, that's a given. What doesn't appear to be getting much attention is the effect of time spoofing.\n\nThe most significant of these is an incident where time was spoofed a significant period into the future. This caused all digital certificates on board an aircraft to become invalid and caused all electronic communications to fail.

How about we do it now? In this talk I’m gonna show you some vulnerabilities that I discovered in the cashless system of one of the biggest companies in the world, with over 2,300 installations across 70 countries, from arcades in Brazil, amusement parks in the United Arab Emirates to a famous roller coaster in Las Vegas. We will talk about API security, access control and NFC among other things.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThe talk is divided into 10(+1) stages. Starting at Stage 0, I will relate the origin of the idea during H2HC Brazil in 2023. Initially, the proposal was an arcade in Brazil with a debit card system.\r\n\r\nIn Stage 1, I will present the company, the NFC card, an application to charge money and check our data, but without exploitable vulnerabilities due to the use of middleware.\r\n\r\nIn the next stage, the focus shifts to the company responsible for the debit card system. This Argentine company dominates the market, with more than 2300 installations in 70 countries, ranging from arcades to a famous roller coaster in Las Vegas. During the investigation, the /api endpoint on the server was identified, filtering out endpoints that did not return 404 or 200. DNS enumeration and the use of Shodan revealed an outdated info.php, as well as other servers with open ports and versions with vulnerabilities. Documentation was also found in /api/v2 without the necessary credentials.\r\n\r\nIn Stage 3, the IDOR and Broken Authentication vulnerabilities will be explained. Then I will present endpoints in the system that allow us to exploit these vulnerabilities and obtain card information and personal customer data.\r\n\r\nThen, it will be revealed that the company provides a mobile application. When decompiling some applications, keys and API endpoints were discovered. All APKs were similar, differing only in keys and endpoints. Now, with these credentials we have the ability to recharge credit to our debit card.\r\n\r\nIn Stage 5, we will explain the Account Takeover attack and how to execute it on the system via API. Also I’ll explain Race Condition found in the API.\r\n\r\nIn the next scenario, a server found in Shodan: The online event booking system. Confidential information was found here, such as all Argentinean invoices, logs and extra company information, obtained by script written by me.\r\n\r\nA reservation management portal was also identified with a Broken Access Control vulnerability, allowing us to view and modify all reservations, including modifying prices. It is important to note that all of these vulnerabilities affect ALL of the company's customers.\r\n\r\nAs we near the end, other servers will be quickly highlighted, such as the company's public Zendesk, allowing user creation and access to useful information. A U.S. case will be presented where a go-karting facility uses this system, allowing access to all monitors. Other examples include an amusement park company in Spain providing links to their park management consoles, and similar findings in Chile, Ecuador and Phoenix.\r\n\r\nThe last scenario will explain the NFC system, focusing on card reading and manipulation due to lack of security. Some attacks, such as changing the ID and referencing another card, will be shown. I’m also going to show the “feature” of emulating the card with the NFC of android phones, thus being able to emulate any card.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the talk is to demonstrate that even in 2024 there are significant systems with many users and with \"basic\" vulnerabilities known for years. Also I would like to encourage new generations to do ethical hacking and help generate a good relationship between hackers and companies. Computer security education and training are crucial to prevent attacks and protect our digital assets.\r\n\r\n## Outline\r\n\r\n- Stage 0\r\n   - Introduction\r\n- Stage 1\r\n   - About Brazilian arcade and cashless system\r\n   - NFC Card\r\n   - Website to charge money and view data\r\n- Stage 2\r\n   - Company who provide the system\r\n   - More than 2300 installations across 70 countries\r\n   - Api endpoints\r\n- Stage 3\r\n   - IDOR and Broken Authentication\r\n   - A lot of user and cards data\r\n   - Not just arcades.

This Argentine company dominates the market, with more than 2300 installations in 70 countries, ranging from arcades to a famous roller coaster in Las Vegas. During the investigation, the /api endpoint on the server was identified, filtering out endpoints that did not return 404 or 200. DNS enumeration and the use of Shodan revealed an outdated info.php, as well as other servers with open ports and versions with vulnerabilities. Documentation was also found in /api/v2 without the necessary credentials.\r\n\r\nIn Stage 3, the IDOR and Broken Authentication vulnerabilities will be explained. Then I will present endpoints in the system that allow us to exploit these vulnerabilities and obtain card information and personal customer data.\r\n\r\nThen, it will be revealed that the company provides a mobile application. When decompiling some applications, keys and API endpoints were discovered. All APKs were similar, differing only in keys and endpoints. Now, with these credentials we have the ability to recharge credit to our debit card.\r\n\r\nIn Stage 5, we will explain the Account Takeover attack and how to execute it on the system via API. Also I’ll explain Race Condition found in the API.\r\n\r\nIn the next scenario, a server found in Shodan: The online event booking system. Confidential information was found here, such as all Argentinean invoices, logs and extra company information, obtained by script written by me.\r\n\r\nA reservation management portal was also identified with a Broken Access Control vulnerability, allowing us to view and modify all reservations, including modifying prices. It is important to note that all of these vulnerabilities affect ALL of the company's customers.\r\n\r\nAs we near the end, other servers will be quickly highlighted, such as the company's public Zendesk, allowing user creation and access to useful information. A U.S. case will be presented where a go-karting facility uses this system, allowing access to all monitors. Other examples include an amusement park company in Spain providing links to their park management consoles, and similar findings in Chile, Ecuador and Phoenix.\r\n\r\nThe last scenario will explain the NFC system, focusing on card reading and manipulation due to lack of security. Some attacks, such as changing the ID and referencing another card, will be shown. I’m also going to show the “feature” of emulating the card with the NFC of android phones, thus being able to emulate any card.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the talk is to demonstrate that even in 2024 there are significant systems with many users and with \"basic\" vulnerabilities known for years. Also I would like to encourage new generations to do ethical hacking and help generate a good relationship between hackers and companies. Computer security education and training are crucial to prevent attacks and protect our digital assets.\r\n\r\n## Outline\r\n\r\n- Stage 0\r\n   - Introduction\r\n- Stage 1\r\n   - About Brazilian arcade and cashless system\r\n   - NFC Card\r\n   - Website to charge money and view data\r\n- Stage 2\r\n   - Company who provide the system\r\n   - More than 2300 installations across 70 countries\r\n   - Api endpoints\r\n- Stage 3\r\n   - IDOR and Broken Authentication\r\n   - A lot of user and cards data\r\n   - Not just arcades.

They use their core services as the foundation of more popular customer-facing offerings. You may think you’re just creating a GCP cloud function in an empty account. In reality, with one click, you’re creating resources in six different services: a Cloud Build instance, a Storage Bucket, an Artifact Registry or a Container Registry, and possibly a Cloud Run instance and Eventarc triggers. The security of the entire stack is only as strong as the weakest link.\n\nBy looking at the entire stack, we can find privilege escalation techniques and even vulnerabilities that are hidden behind the stack. In my research, I was able to find a novel privilege escalation vulnerability and several privilege escalation techniques in GCP.\n\nThe talk will showcase a key concept, sometimes not discussed enough: cloud services are built on top of each other, and one click in the console can cause many things to happen behind the scenes. More services mean more risks and a larger attack surface.\n\nThe next part will dive deep into the vulnerable GCP cloud functions deployment flow. I will showcase the vulnerability I found in this flow, which enables an attacker to run code as the default Cloud Build service account by exploiting the deployment flow and the flawed trust between services resulting in a large fix and change in GCP IAM and Cloud Functions. This would grant an attacker high privileges to key services such as Storage, Artifact Registry, and Cloud Build.\n\nHowever, this talk is about more than just a vulnerability. By understanding cross-service dependency, we can reveal a broad attack surface for many possible privilege escalation vectors between services. I will demo a simple tool I wrote to find the hidden APIs that are called by the CSP when performing an action.\n\nBy the end of this talk, the audience will learn the dangers of treating cloud services like a black box. The talk explains the hidden deployment flow behind one important stack, and provides the tools to uncover the risks of many more.\n\n\n","media":[],"title":"One Click, Six Services: Abusing The Dangerous Multi-service Orchestration Pattern","type":{"conference_id":133,"conference":"DEFCON32","updated_at":"2024-07-21T19:20+0000","color":"#069622","name":"Creator Talk/Panel","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T19:20:45Z","id":46511},"end_tsz":"2024-08-10T19:15:00Z","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1723317300,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Cloud providers build their services a little like Jenga towers.

The outputs of the framework describe a target model’s weaknesses, contribute to an informed discussion of what composes vulnerabilities in unique contexts, and can inform alignment and policy discussions for LLM deployment.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722625241,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[55882,54175],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[56467,54544],"name":"Erick Galinkin","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"NVIDIA","title":"Research Scientist"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":53735,"title":"Research Scientist at NVIDIA"},{"content_ids":[55882,54175],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[56467,54544],"name":"Leon Derczynski","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"ITU Copenhagen","title":"Prof, Natural Language Processing"},{"organization":"NVIDIA","title":"Principal Research Scientist, LLM Security"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":53749,"title":"Principal Research Scientist, LLM Security at NVIDIA"},{"content_ids":[55882],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[56467],"name":"Jeffery Martin","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"NVIDIA","title":""}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":56247,"title":"NVIDIA"},{"content_ids":[55882],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[56467],"name":"Subho Majumdar","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"vijil","title":""}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":56248,"title":"vijil"}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-10T18:30:00Z","timeband_id":1148,"updated_tsz":"2024-08-02T19:00:41Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-10T19:30:00.000-0000","id":56467,"tag_ids":[46368,46511],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723314600,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":2,"person_id":53749},{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":4,"person_id":53735},{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":6,"person_id":56247},{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":8,"person_id":56248}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46255,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW2-07-03","hotel":"","short_name":"HW2-07-03","id":46260},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-10T18:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-08-02T19:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Learn how to build a device to emulate magstripe using data intercepted from EMV chip and contactless interfaces\n\n\n","media":[],"title":"Emulating Magstripe with Arduino","type":{"conference_id":133,"conference":"DEFCON32","updated_at":"2024-07-21T19:20+0000","color":"#752A1D","name":"Creator Workshop","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T19:20:45Z","id":46734},"end_tsz":"2024-08-10T19:10:00Z","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1723317000,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Learn how to build a device to emulate magstripe using data intercepted from EMV chip and contactless interfaces","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722356245,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[55566,55567,55568],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[56081,56082,56089,56091,56092],"name":"Leigh-Anne Galloway","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"UNDERLE LTD","title":"Director of Research"}],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/leighannegalloway/"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@L_Agalloway)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/L_Agalloway"}],"media":[],"id":56039,"title":"Director of Research at UNDERLE LTD"}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-10T18:30:00Z","timeband_id":1148,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-30T16:17:25Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-10T19:10:00.000-0000","id":56089,"tag_ids":[46386,46427,46734],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723314600,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46484,"sort_order":2,"person_id":56039}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46252,"name":"LVCC - L2 - W202","hotel":"","short_name":"W202","id":46282},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-10T18:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-30T16:17:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Amid the Gen-AI revolution, notably through the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), the cybersecurity landscape faces opportunities and challenges.

We’ll provide an overview about Quick Share’s protocol, present our fuzzer, the found vulnerabilities, a new HTTPS MITM technique, and finally the RCE chain.\r\n\r\n[Reference link](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/files/10367/ndss19-paper367.pdf)","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1721090347,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54485],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54858],"name":"Or Yair","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"SafeBreach","title":"Security Research Team Lead"}],"pronouns":"he/him","links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/or-yair/"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@oryair1999)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/oryair1999"},{"description":"","title":"Website","sort_order":0,"url":"https://oryair.com"}],"media":[],"id":54145,"title":"Security Research Team Lead at SafeBreach"},{"content_ids":[54485],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54858],"name":"Shmuel Cohen","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"SafeBreach","title":"Senior Security Researcher"}],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/the-shmuel-cohen/"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@BinWalker)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/BinWalker"}],"media":[],"id":54185,"title":"Senior Security Researcher at SafeBreach"}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-10T18:30:00Z","timeband_id":1148,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-16T00:39:07Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-10T19:15:00.000-0000","id":54858,"tag_ids":[46166,46169,46419,46437,46438,46879],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723314600,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Demo 💻, Exploit 🪲, Tool 🛠","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54145},{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":2,"person_id":54185}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46254,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW1-11-02 (Track 2)","hotel":"","short_name":"HW1-11-02 (Track 2)","id":46301},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-10T18:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-16T00:39:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Introduction:\r\nWe will begin with an overview of event analysis systems and their challenges. Participants will learn about different types of data sources and logs, the prevalence of false positives, and the difficulty in identifying coordinated attacks. We will set the stage for the live, hands-on demonstration environment where participants can interact and apply what they learn in real-time. Importantly, no prior data science knowledge is required; all tasks will be performed using simple, user-friendly interfaces.\r\n\r\nIntroduction to MITRE ATT&CK Framework:\r\nAn essential part of our session is understanding the MITRE ATT&CK framework. We will cover its structure, including Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), and explain why mapping alerts to this framework is crucial for standardizing threat detection and enhancing our capabilities.\r\n\r\nLeveraging Open Source AI Tools:\r\nNext, we will delve into the open-source AI tools that will be used throughout the session. We will introduce families of algorithms including clustering and community detection, natural language processing with large language models (LLMs), and Markov chains. These tools are designed to be accessible and will be operated through straightforward interfaces. Participants will be guided through setting up a demo environment to follow along and interact with the exercises.\r\n\r\nData Preprocessing and Normalization:\r\nParticipants will learn how to import and clean data from various sources, normalize data formats, and handle missing data. We will highlight some methods to get rich test data. This step is crucial for ensuring that the subsequent analysis is accurate and reliable. The hands-on exercise will involve preprocessing a sample dataset in real-time, using easy-to-follow steps and intuitive interfaces.\r\n\r\nMapping Alerts to MITRE ATT&CK Techniques:\r\nWe will demonstrate techniques for mapping SIEM data to MITRE ATT&CK manually and using automated tools. The live demo will include a hands-on exercise where participants will map a sample dataset to MITRE ATT&CK Techniques, using AI to enhance mapping accuracy. All this will be done through simple interfaces that do not require deep technical knowledge.\r\n\r\nClustering Alerts into Contextualized Attack Steps:\r\nThis section focuses on methods such as clustering and community detection. Participants will learn the criteria for clustering alerts based on temporal, spatial, and technical attributes. They will engage in a hands-on exercise to cluster sample alerts and evaluate the quality and relevance of the clusters, again using user-friendly interfaces.\r\n\r\nBuilding Killchains:\r\nParticipants will understand the concept and importance of killchains in cybersecurity. We will demonstrate methods for linking attack steps into a cohesive killchain, with a hands-on exercise to create a killchain from clustered data. Participants will analyze killchains to identify patterns and coordinated attacks, all through accessible interfaces.\r\n\r\nGenerating Actionable Tickets:\r\nWe will outline the criteria for generating three types of tickets: FP Tickets, Incident Tickets, and Attack Story Tickets. Through a hands-on exercise, participants will generate sample tickets and learn how to ensure each ticket type is comprehensive and actionable. This process will be facilitated through simple interfaces that guide the user step-by-step.\r\n\r\nIntegrating and Automating the Workflow:\r\nFinally, we will discuss integrating this workflow into existing SOC setups and automating the process using scripts and tools. Participants will see how to maintain and update the system, ensuring continuous improvement in threat detection and response. The automation will be demonstrated in a way that requires minimal technical skills.\r\n\r\nQ&A and Troubleshooting:\r\nThe session will conclude with an open floor for questions, addressing common issues, and offering troubleshooting tips. Participants will also receive resources for further learning and support to continue enhancing their skills post-session.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nBy the end of this interactive session, participants will have hands-on experience using open-source AI tools to enhance their SOC capabilities. They will be able to map alerts to MITRE ATT&CK Techniques, cluster data into meaningful attack steps, and build comprehensive killchains to uncover coordinated attacks. Additionally, they will learn to generate actionable tickets to facilitate immediate response and long-term improvements in their security posture. All of this will be achieved without needing advanced data science knowledge, thanks to the simple and intuitive interfaces provided.\r\n\r\nParticipants are encouraged to apply these techniques in their own environments and continue exploring the vast capabilities of open-source AI in cybersecurity. The live demo environment setup will provide a practical and engaging way to solidify these concepts and skills.\n\n\nGiven a SIEM loaded with alerts, logs and events from a variety of data sources, your task is to find the coordinated attack in the LOTS of noise of false positives & lone incidents. \r\n\r\nTogether we will use opensource AI tools to map all of the hetrogenous data on the SIEM to MITRE ATT&CK Techniques, and then Cluster based on a variety of attributes to form contetualized Attack Steps. We will then fuse these attack steps based on timeline, causality and assets involved into killchains to reveal coordinated attacks. \r\n\r\nYou are required to output the following tickets: \r\n1. FP Ticket that has clusters of false positives and tuning advisories & suggestions that should be forwarded to detection engineering to tune. \r\n\r\n2.

It empowers developers to create custom providers for provisioning a wide array of infrastructure resources. Terraform provider functions as binary files on the server and interacts with terraform binary through RPC communication during terraform run.

The hope is that all sorts of creative devices will be connected up to each other to move bits through various complicated and fun analog/digital methods. Ideas have ranged from simply wiring RX to TX — to using radios to bounce the message off the moon!","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722821818,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-10T17:00:00Z","timeband_id":1148,"updated_tsz":"2024-08-05T01:36:58Z","links":[{"label":"More Info","type":"link","url":"https://dchhv.org/events/hhv_rgb.html"}],"end":"2024-08-11T01:00:00.000-0000","id":56762,"tag_ids":[46381,46427,46641],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723309200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46255,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW2-10-01","hotel":"","short_name":"HW2-10-01","id":46264},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-10T17:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-08-05T01:36:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"If you have never participated in a Robo Sumo event before, welcome to the crowd!

Various levels of self-driving functionalities, such as AI-powered perception, sensor fusion and route planning, are entering the product portfolio of automobile companies. From the security perspective, these AI-powered components not only contain common security problems such as memory safety bugs, but also introduce new threats such as physical adversarial attacks and sensor manipulations. Two popular examples of physical adversarial attacks are camouflage stickers that interfere with vehicle detection systems, and road graffitis that disturb lane keeping systems. The AI-powered navigation and control relies on the fusion of multiple sensor inputs, and many of the sensor inputs can be manipulated by malicious attackers. These manipulations combined with logical bugs in autonomous driving systems pose severe threats to road safety.\r\n\r\nWe design autonomous driving CTF (AutoDriving CTF) contests around the security challenges specific to these self-driving functions and components.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the AutoDriving CTF are the followings:\r\n\r\n- Demonstrate security implications of autonomous driving system design decisions through hands-on challenges, increase the awareness of potential risks in security professionals, and encourage them to propose defense solutions and tools to detect such risks.\r\n- Provide CTF challenges that allow players to learn attack and defense practices related to autonomous driving in a well-controlled, repeatable, and visible environment.\r\n- Build a set of vulnerable autonomous driving components that can be used for security research and defense evaluation.\r\n\r\nThe contest is based on a Jeopardy style of CTF game with a set of independent challenges. A typical contest challenge includes a backend that runs autonomous driving components in simulated or real environments, and a frontend that interacts with the players. This year's contest will follow the style of last year and includes the following types of challenges:\r\n\r\n- “attack”: such as constructing adversarial patches and spoofing fake sensor inputs,\r\n- “forensics”: such as investigating a security incident related to autonomous driving,\r\n- “detection”: such as detecting spoofed sensor inputs and fake obstacles,\r\n- “crashme on road!”: such as creating dangerous traffic scenarios to expose logical errors in autonomous driving systems.\r\n- “smart planner”: such as creating intelligent path planners for dangerous tasks that are difficult for human drivers\r\n\r\nMost of these challenges will be developed using game-engine based autonomous driving simulators, such as CARLA and SVL.

New difficulty levels will be added to challenges in such scenarios by integrating real downstream AI modules such as object tracking from open-source autonomous driving software like Apollo, Autoware and OpenPilot.\r\n\r\nIn order to enable the audience to experience the challenges more directly, we plan to set up a vehicle wheel controller on site and provide a driving game this year.

Our shared passions fostered an immediate bond, and it was amidst this camaraderie that the idea for a future challenge germinated. Having previously engaged participants with puzzle-embedded challenge coins, I (Chasse) was inspired to expand the concept beyond a mere cipher. The aim was to design a contest that would appeal across a broad spectrum of skill levels by integrating a variety of puzzles, both modern and traditional, to attract a wider audience from a complete beginner new to the hackerspace to the more seasoned and advanced hacker. Observing the collective enthusiasm as participants unraveled the first simple coin puzzle was exhilarating, yet the quick resolution of the puzzle occasionally detracted from the overall experience for more advanced puzzle solvers. Throughout DEF CON 31, CookieT and I  explored the feasibility of a web-based challenge CTF, laying the foundation for what would evolve into a pioneering contest and experience. Later Raven emerged from the shadows of cyberspace to help us chisel out the contest from Zeroes and Ones\r\n\r\nWith the announcement of DEF CON 32's theme, our concept was honed, ready to blend our creative talents into this year's challenge. We crafted an innovative combination of a narrative-driven journey game, scavenger hunt, and web-based Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, all meticulously aligned with the DEC CON 32 \"Engage\" theme. This contest emerges as a holistic platform, introducing DEF CON newcomers to core security principles through an engaging narrative. Spanning a variety of fields including OSINT, cryptography, radio, telephony, password, and web security. It promises a rich, diverse experience! Participants, automatically divided into teams, are propelled on a quest to decode puzzles and unearth flags, with challenges designed to suit everyone from novices to veterans seeking sophisticated, intricate challenges. This contest transcends the conventional competition framework, evolving into an artful endeavor that illustrates the symbiosis of storytelling and technical puzzles to create a deeply immersive learning adventure. Imagined as an interactive storybook, it invites attendees to navigate their own routes, making their own choices that lead them through a story-rich exploration of security concepts and engagement even with each other.\r\n\r\nThe technical infrastructure of this experience is built on varied technologies.

Your task is to use the available information that your team has at your disposal to stop the adversary from achieving their objective.\r\n\r\nPlayers will find themselves in a variety of future scenarios based on a specific industry/sector focus e.g. manufacturing, utilities, defense, finance. The task will be to defend each individual network/system to govern, identify, detect, respond and recover against abnormal/suspicious activities on the network. You will be working against a global hacker network who are threatening to disrupt the overall operations of global critical infrastructure sites for their own nefarious means.\r\n\r\nYour team must protect various networks/systems as part of a global environment. If 5 or more systems are compromised and deactivated, the hacker network successfully disabled the global environment and can assume control of the entire environment. It is your mission to protect the environment and ensure the availability of the global system.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722310334,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-10T17:00:00Z","timeband_id":1148,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-30T03:32:14Z","links":[{"label":"Sub-forum (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/249384"},{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/249385"}],"end":"2024-08-11T01:00:00.000-0000","id":56037,"tag_ids":[46439,46762],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723309200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46257,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW4-03-06-C","hotel":"","short_name":"HW4-03-06-C","id":46376},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-10T17:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-30T03:32:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Darknet-NG is an Alternate Reality Game (ARG), where the players take on the Persona of an Agent who is sent on Quests to learn real skills and gain in-game points.

If participants register for this challenge more than once, the whole teams with a participant that registered multiple times will be disqualified.\r\n\r\nBy registering, participants agree that their accounts may be rejected or terminated and all submissions by them and/or their Team may be disqualified if any of the information in their account is incorrect.\r\n\r\nParticipants must agree to and abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://www.villageb.io/code-of-conduct) while participating in the Biohacking Village Capture the Flag. Anyone who will conduct themselves against the CoC will be eliminated from competition and banned forever.\r\n\r\n## TEAMS\r\n\r\nAfter participants register individually, they may work alone (team of one) or on one team with other challenge participants. To work on a team, they may either create a new team or join one that is pre-existing ( if a participant wishes to join a team or offer others to join, they can do so in the #ctf-st-elvis-teambuilding Discord Channel)\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of team members is five (5).\r\n\r\nAll teams must designate a Team Captain. A Team Captain serves as the official contact person for a team: this person should provide accurate and complete contact information to ensure that CTF organizers can reach their team if needed.\r\n\r\nEach member of the team must be a registered participant in the CTF.\r\n\r\nIf participants choose to join a team, then they may not simultaneously participate as an individual or another team. \r\n\r\n## CHALLENGE SUBMISSIONS\r\n\r\nAll submissions must be received during the Challenge period. Submissions posted after the posted time frame will be disqualified.\r\n\r\nParticipants may get an answer but it will forfeit their points for that challenge. Even if the flag they tried before was similar. The decision to get the answer is final for zero points.\r\n\r\n## CHALLENGE SCORING\r\n\r\nEach submission has set value known beforehand in the challenge description\r\n\r\nThe winning teams will be decided based on the number of the accumulated points during the CTF timeframe. In case two teams accumulate the same amount of points, the team that reached the amount of points in question faster will be the winner.\r\n\r\n## CHALLENGE DISQUALIFICATION\r\n\r\nWhole team gets disqualified if any of the following applies:\r\n\r\n - One or multiple team members have registered more than once\r\n - One or multiple team members will not follow [Code of Conduct](https://www.villageb.io/code-of-conduct) (applies to any of the Biohacking village platforms or social media)\r\n - Any offensive behaviour such as attacking the Biohacking Village infrastructure, denial of service, or escaping the boundaries set by the CTF or Device Lab environment\r\n\r\n## PRIVACY\r\n\r\nUnless stated otherwise on the mainsite, we do not share any information about participants with anyone.

These systems exist at the intersection of hardware and software, built to accomplish a specific task. However, unlike general-purpose computers, embedded systems are typically designed for a particular case of use and have limited resources. This makes them both challenging and fascinating to work with, especially from a security perspective. Often these disciplines are dealt with individually, but understanding the custom relationships between hardware and software is vital to performing security research on these devices.\r\n\r\nThe embedded device CTF contest is an exciting opportunity to explore the intricacies of these systems and test your skills in a competitive environment. Contestants are challenged to find vulnerabilities in the firmware or hardware and exploit them to gain access or control over the device. The contest offers a unique opportunity to explore embedded devices' inner workings and understand their design's security implications.\r\n\r\nNew devices will be dramatically introduced at set intervals throughout the competition, and point values will decrease over time. This keeps contestants guessing and on their toes, forcing them to adapt and use their skills to tackle new challenges. It also offers a chance to learn about different types of devices and how they function, broadening participants' knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\nBy participating in the contest, contestants can develop a deep understanding of how these systems operate and how to secure them against potential attacks. Additionally, the contest encourages participants to think outside the box and approach problems creatively, honing their problem-solving skills. The competition provides a valuable opportunity to network with like-minded individuals and a chance to learn from others in the field hands-on.\r\n\r\nOverall, the embedded device CTF contest is an exciting and educational experience that showcases the unique challenges and rewards of working with embedded devices. With the rise of the Internet of Things and the increasing integration of technology in our daily lives, embedded devices are becoming more ubiquitous, making this contest relevant and worth checking out.

These systems exist at the intersection of hardware and software, built to accomplish a specific task. However, unlike general-purpose computers, embedded systems are typically designed for a particular case of use and have limited resources. This makes them both challenging and fascinating to work with, especially from a security perspective. Often these disciplines are dealt with individually, but understanding the custom relationships between hardware and software is vital to performing security research on these devices.\r\n\r\nThe embedded device CTF contest is an exciting opportunity to explore the intricacies of these systems and test your skills in a competitive environment. Contestants are challenged to find vulnerabilities in the firmware or hardware and exploit them to gain access or control over the device. The contest offers a unique opportunity to explore embedded devices' inner workings and understand their design's security implications.\r\n\r\nNew devices will be dramatically introduced at set intervals throughout the competition, and point values will decrease over time. This keeps contestants guessing and on their toes, forcing them to adapt and use their skills to tackle new challenges. It also offers a chance to learn about different types of devices and how they function, broadening participants' knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\nBy participating in the contest, contestants can develop a deep understanding of how these systems operate and how to secure them against potential attacks. Additionally, the contest encourages participants to think outside the box and approach problems creatively, honing their problem-solving skills. The competition provides a valuable opportunity to network with like-minded individuals and a chance to learn from others in the field hands-on.\r\n\r\nOverall, the embedded device CTF contest is an exciting and educational experience that showcases the unique challenges and rewards of working with embedded devices. With the rise of the Internet of Things and the increasing integration of technology in our daily lives, embedded devices are becoming more ubiquitous, making this contest relevant and worth checking out. Whether you're a seasoned security professional or just starting in the field, the contest offers a chance to learn, test your skills, and have fun in a dynamic and competitive environment.\r\n\r\nThis is the main event at Embedded Systems Village.

We will explore the unique challenges that agriculture faces, including the dispersed nature of operations, the integration of legacy systems with modern technologies, and the reliance on remote access and IoT devices.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1721781676,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[55340,55349],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[55732,55741],"name":"Ray Baeza","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"Agriculture Defense Group","title":"Founder"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":55964,"title":"Founder at Agriculture Defense Group"}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-10T17:00:00Z","timeband_id":1148,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-24T00:41:16Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-10T17:55:00.000-0000","id":55741,"tag_ids":[46382,46511],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723309200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":2,"person_id":55964}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46256,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW3-06-05","hotel":"","short_name":"HW3-06-05","id":46272},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-10T17:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-24T00:41:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"In the era of innovation and growth, technology and evolving landscape of cloud services, hybrid environments has become crucial for running smooth business operations.

We will explain why DNS over HTTPS (DoH) was conceived, what motivations drove it, and why vulnerabilities from its predecessor tried to mitigate them. Next, we will demonstrate how attackers can leverage DNS and DoH to create tunnels, which are covert channels for communication that bypass traditional network security measures. These tunnels can be used to exfiltrate information or as C&C (Command and Control) communication channels for malicious activities. Additionally, we will highlight the most popular tools for creating these tunnels using DoH.\r\n\r\n2 DoH Tunnel Detection Models\r\nThis section will discuss the primary datasets the scientific community uses to create ML models for detecting DoH tunnels. We will highlight how to extract features from DoH requests and which are the most used. We will also address the gaps and bad practices in these datasets that lead to developing vulnerable models. Additionally, we will show the best practices for building DoH tunnel detection models, such as choosing the best algorithms, implementing robust feature engineering techniques, and selecting the most relevant features for the model.\r\n\r\n3 Adversarial Attacks\r\nThis section will introduce adversarial attacks, a type of attack that aims to deceive or mislead a machine learning model by providing it with maliciously crafted input data. We will explain how 'white' and 'black' attacks on ML models are executed and how they differ. Furthermore, we will explain how to adapt 'black-box attacks, a type of adversarial attack where the attacker does not know the internal workings of the model, to target DoH tunnel detection models and similar models.\r\n\r\n4 Attacking (DEMOs)\r\nThis section will present demos covering the following scenarios: First, we will demonstrate how basic black-box attacks work for attacking DoH tunnel detection models. Next, we will show a demo using previous attacks, but this time, we will incorporate real-world inputs from DoH tunnel detection tools, constraining the attack algorithm. We will also identify vulnerable features within the dataset that attackers can exploit to bypass the DoH tunnel detection models. Additionally, we will release a patched open-source tool, dnstt, to consider all considered scenarios.\r\nNote: The demonstrations will be conducted live, but we will have pre-recorded videos to ensure continuity in case of any issues.\r\n\r\n5 Defending\r\nThis section will explain how to defend against the attacks presented earlier and demonstrate 'good practices and techniques' for protecting against them. We will also show how to build a robust model trained with adversarial attack samples generated from previous attacks, which can help improve the model's resilience to future attacks.\r\n\r\n6 Next Steps\r\nIn the final section, we will outline the future steps in our research and discuss the remaining gaps.

Effectively, by understanding the building blocks of AV detection and evasion phases, anyone can develop their own evasion tool.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1721541572,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[55285],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[55675],"name":"Thomas X Meng","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":55839}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-10T17:00:00Z","timeband_id":1148,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T05:59:32Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-10T17:50:00.000-0000","id":55675,"tag_ids":[46392,46734],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723309200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":2,"person_id":55839}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46283,"name":"LVCC - L2 - W204-W207 (RTV) - Haven (Track 1)","hotel":"","short_name":"Haven (Track 1)","id":46500},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-10T17:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-21T05:59:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Nikkia Henderson is a 14 year tenured federal government employee.

It can take significant time with the human eye to analyze each image or video. Furthermore, you may miss important artifacts in the foreground or background. Computer vision can churn through the plethora of data to pull out the relevant evidence at lightning speed. For the last 5 years we’ve been exploring the use of Azure and AWS for computer vision to rapidly process large sets of image and video data acquisitions for forensic evidence.Through the use of AI we have analyzed thousands of images and videos to perform object detection, facial recognition, OCR, voice to text analysis, and more. In this session we’ll explore the use of cloud platforms to exponentially increase your analysis of uncovering key artifacts to your case using demos and real world examples.

It can take significant time with the human eye to analyze each image or video. Furthermore, you may miss important artifacts in the foreground or background. Computer vision can churn through the plethora of data to pull out the relevant evidence at lightning speed. For the last 5 years we’ve been exploring the use of Azure and AWS for computer vision to rapidly process large sets of image and video data acquisitions for forensic evidence.Through the use of AI we have analyzed thousands of images and videos to perform object detection, facial recognition, OCR, voice to text analysis, and more. In this session we’ll explore the use of cloud platforms to exponentially increase your analysis of uncovering key artifacts to your case using demos and real world examples.

This talk will include interactive demos involving official HID readers and hardware, proxmark3, and the flipper zero.\r\n\r\n- [link](https://www.hidglobal.com/doclib/files/resource_files/an0109_a.2_credential_id_markings_application_note.pdf)\r\n- [link](https://gist.github.com/bettse/36f25f9a2fcca74d773587cc8e780766)\r\n- [link](https://ipvm.com/reports/hid-downgrade)\r\n- [link](https://ipvm.com/reports/iclass-se-not-cracked)\r\n- [link](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3/blob/master/doc/hid_downgrade.md)","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720462829,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54478],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54851],"name":"Xavier Zhang","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":"he/him","media":[],"id":54101}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-10T17:00:00Z","timeband_id":1148,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-08T18:20:29Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-10T17:20:00.000-0000","id":54851,"tag_ids":[46166,46169,46419,46880],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723309200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Demo 💻","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54101}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46254,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW1-11-03 (Track 3)","hotel":"","short_name":"HW1-11-03 (Track 3)","id":46302},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-10T17:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-08T18:20:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"CSC ServiceWorks is a large vendor of pay-to-play laundry machines in apartments and condomiums.

This helps the community to solve common challenges and getting started working with the CSTC.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1718922742,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[55732,54194],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[56259,54563],"name":"Florian Haag","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"usd AG","title":"Managing Security Consultant"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":53737,"title":"Managing Security Consultant at usd AG"},{"content_ids":[55732,54194],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[56259,54563],"name":"Matthias Göhring","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"usd AG","title":"Security Consultant and Penetration Tester"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":53759,"title":"Security Consultant and Penetration Tester at usd AG"}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-10T17:00:00Z","timeband_id":1148,"updated_tsz":"2024-06-20T22:32:22Z","links":[{"label":"DEF CON Forums","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/249625"},{"label":"Project","type":"link","url":"https://github.com/usdAG/cstc"}],"end":"2024-08-10T18:45:00.000-0000","id":54563,"tag_ids":[46169,46441,46443,46453],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723309200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Demo 💻","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":2,"person_id":53737},{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":4,"person_id":53759}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46253,"name":"LVCC - L3 - W307","hotel":"","short_name":"W307","id":46322},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-10T17:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-06-20T22:32:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"As the landscape of industrial control systems (ICS) evolves, the security vulnerabilities inherent in these systems have become increasingly important.

Please be patient. All of the times listed here are **approximate**. \r\n\r\n# Basics\r\n\r\n### Who needs a badge?\r\n\r\nA badge is required for each human age 8 and older.\r\n\r\n### Human?\r\n\r\nYou are a human if you do not know otherwise. People that are not humans include goons, official speaker, village/community/contest/creator staff, press, black badge holders, or similar. If you are not a human, you need to register separately. If you don't know how, see an NFO goon (NFO Node, formerly known as an infobooth, is where you can get help). The remainder of this message applies only to humans.\r\n\r\n### Lines? Linecon?\r\n\r\nLinecon is your optional opportunity to stand (or sit) in line for human registration to open. Doors will open for linecon on Wednesday at approximately 17:00. When human registration opens on Thursday at approximately 08:00, they start working the linecon queue, and the line will start moving quickly. (Please understand that we will begin processing the line on Thursday morning as soon as the cashiers and materials are in place; we will strive for Thursday 08:00, but actual start may be slightly earlier or later.)\r\n\r\nOnline badge purchase (aka pre-registration) has no impact on linecon. You can join the line on Wednesday (if you wish) regardless of whether you purchased a badge online or intend to pay with cash. There is only one linecon for both types of badge sales. \r\n\r\nPlease help us make this a great experience for everyone by **following directions given by goons**. After human registration opens, there may be one line for all of registration, or there may be two lines (one for online sales (pre-registration) and one for cash sales). This may also change over time, based on available staffing and necessary crowd control. We will strive to make it easily understandable in-person as to which line you should join. \r\n\r\n# Ways to buy a badge\r\n\r\n- $480 [online purchase](https://shop.defcon.org/products/def-con-32-las-vegas-convention-center) until August 1, 2024. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.\r\n- $460 cash purchase on-site.\r\n- As part of a BlackHat registration.\r\n\r\n### Online Purchase\r\n\r\nYou will be emailed a QR code to the email address provided when you bought your badge. Please guard that QR code as though it is cash -- it can only be redeemed once, and anyone can redeem it if they have it (including a photo of it). Badges are picked-up on-site -- they will not be mailed or shipped.\r\n\r\nWe can scan the QR code either from your phone's display or from a printed copy. You **must** have the QR code with you in order to obtain your badge. As you approach the front of the line, if you are going to show your QR code on an electronic device, please ensure that your display is set to maximum brightness. \r\n\r\nIf you pre-registered, but ultimately are unable to attend DEF CON and want to cancel your purchase, the **only** way to get a refund is from the original online source. We are unable to provide any refunds on-site at DEF CON. There is a fee to have your badge canceled: $34 until July 15, and $84 on and after July 15.\r\n\r\nOnline purchases are provided a receipt via email when the purchase is made.\r\n\r\nOnline purchase -- often referred to as pre-registration -- does not allow you to skip any line/queue to pick up your badge. Once you arrive on-site, you will need to join the existing line for human registration. There may or may not be a dedicated line for pre-registration badge pickup, depending on when you arrive, how long the line is, available staff, etc.\r\n\r\n### Cash Purchase\r\n\r\nBadges will be available for purchase on-site at DEF CON. All badge sales are **cash only**. No checks, money orders, credit cards, etc., will be accepted. In order to keep the registration line moving as quickly as possible, please have **exact change** ready as you near the front of the line.\r\n\r\nThere are no refunds given for cash sales. If you have any doubt about your desire to buy a badge, please refrain from doing so.\r\n\r\nWe are unable to provide printed receipts at the time of the sale. A generic receipt for the cash sale of a badge will be made available on media.defcon.org after the conference. You are welcome to print your own copy of the receipt on plain paper.\r\n\r\n### Via BlackHat \r\n\r\nIf you attend BlackHat, it is possible to purchase a DEF CON badge with your BlackHat registration. If you did so, please get your DEF CON badge from BlackHat before they close. \r\n\r\nBlackHat should send you an email with instructions for how to obtain your DEF CON badge. In case you missed it, you can go to the second floor, at the concierge desk, halfway down Black Hat Blvd.\r\n\r\n# Misc\r\n\r\nWant to buy multiple badges? No problem!

The common element across my career was the search for vulnerabilities in the name of defense - finding them, making sense of them, leading organizations to find them, and then translating that knowledge into action to prevent or manage them. I'll share lessons learned as cyberdefense evolved from a focus on mathematics and cryptography to systems and software; and from government security to a global internet.

How can we translate what we learn through product testing, Red Teams, Blue Teams, systems analysis, etc. into operational guidance, best practices, requirements, training, and security improvements? How can we bridge the gap between telling people what they are doing wrong, and helping them do what's right? This led to projects like the release of NSA Security Guides to the public (www.nsa.gov), involvement in open standards for security automation and information sharing, and an activity now known as the Critical Security Controls.\r\n\r\nSince retirement in 2012, I have been able to continue to serve the cause of cyber defense through our work at the non-profit Center for Internet Security, and the Council on CyberSecurity before that.

I'll share lessons learned as cyberdefense evolved from a focus on mathematics and cryptography to systems and software; and from government security to a global internet. And we'll focus on the mission, technical, and cultural interplay of cyberdefense and offense/intelligence as it played out at NSA. War stories, culture clashes, bureaucratic mazes? Of course! But in the end, better security for all.\r\n\r\nCommunications Security, Computer Security, Information Security, Information Assurance, Defensive Information Operations, and several more - I'm very lucky to have ridden the World-Wide Wave we now call cybersecurity.\r\n\r\nAnd I am very proud to have spent 35 years in Federal Service at the National Security Agency as part of the Information Assurance mission. The common element across my career was the search for vulnerabilities in the name of defense - finding vulnerabilities, making sense of them, leading organizations to find them, and then translating that knowledge into action to prevent or manage them.\r\n\r\nThat final challenge consumed the last third of my government career. How can we translate what we learn through product testing, Red Teams, Blue Teams, systems analysis, etc. into operational guidance, best practices, requirements, training, and security improvements? How can we bridge the gap between telling people what they are doing wrong, and helping them do what's right? This led to projects like the release of NSA Security Guides to the public (www.nsa.gov), involvement in open standards for security automation and information sharing, and an activity now known as the Critical Security Controls.\r\n\r\nSince retirement in 2012, I have been able to continue to serve the cause of cyber defense through our work at the non-profit Center for Internet Security, and the Council on CyberSecurity before that. And I am very active in more volunteer cybersecurity causes than I can recall.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720310096,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54474],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54847],"name":"Tony Sager","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"Center for Internet Security (CIS)","title":"Senior VP & Chief Evangelist"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54110,"title":"Senior VP & Chief Evangelist at Center for Internet Security (CIS)"}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-10T00:30:00Z","timeband_id":1147,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-06T23:54:56Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-10T00:50:00.000-0000","id":54847,"tag_ids":[46166,46419,46882],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723249800,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54110}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46253,"name":"LVCC - L3 - W322-W327 (Warstories Track)","hotel":"","short_name":"W322-W327 (Warstories Track)","id":46314},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-10T00:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-06T23:54:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Over the past decade, infotainment systems have experienced a growth in functionality, broader adoption, and central incorporation into vehicle architecture.

However, the issues we as the Netherlands are struggling\nwith have still not been resolved to this very day.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1723183539,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[56191],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[56845],"name":"Fleur van Leusden","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://linkedin.com/in/fleur-%F0%9F%8E%99%F0%9F%A6%8A-van-leusden-356bb054"}],"media":[],"id":56568}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-10T00:00:00Z","timeband_id":1147,"updated_tsz":"2024-08-09T06:05:39Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-10T00:45:00.000-0000","id":56845,"tag_ids":[46396,46511],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723248000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":2,"person_id":56568}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46252,"name":"LVCC -

In most of the US, primary and secondary education (in the US, comprising kindergarten through 12th grade) now incorporate computing technology as an integral part of the classroom, and some families introduce computing platforms to children in their toddler and preschool years. Despite our society's growing dependence on computing technology in the world of education, there remain no national standards or curricula for the teaching of data privacy or information security principles.

In most of the US, primary and secondary education (in the US, comprising kindergarten through 12th grade) now incorporate computing technology as an integral part of the classroom, and some families introduce computing platforms to children in their toddler and preschool years. Despite our society's growing dependence on computing technology in the world of education, there remain no national standards or curricula for the teaching of data privacy or information security principles. This disconnect sets future generations up for failure, and a continuation of a cycle of ignorance that perpetuates cybercrime victimization.

The majority of discussions revolve around direct communication and access to spacecraft through means such as Software Defined Radio. However, the reality is that this approach isn't practical for most adversaries, as it requires substantial resources and is easily detectable due to the power and radio frequencies required to command a spacecraft. Instead, adversaries might shift their focus away from the Space Segment and opt for a more practical approach, such as accessing and exploiting the Ground Segment vulnerabilities and flaws in order to gain control over spacecraft. Every space mission comprises custom-made hardware and software components, which interact with each other utilizing dedicated protocols and standards designed and developed for this sole purpose. Numerous potential failure points can adversely impact a space mission, many of which persist on the ground. Considering the essential services they facilitate and the extent to which contemporary society relies on space technology, each component utilized in space missions should be regarded as integral to critical infrastructure and treated as such, particularly from a security standpoint. This study centers on the Space Link Extension (SLE) protocol, which is employed as a standard for communication between mission data systems and ground stations by various space agencies and organizations, including NASA and ESA. We will address the security concerns inherent in the SLE protocol. At the same time, we demonstrate methods and techniques malicious actors can employ to conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) or tap into the ground station communications, gaining control over an actual spacecraft. We will conclude this publication by presenting the reader with a possible mitigation strategy that we believe should be employed at the SLE protocol level. Additionally, we will outline a forecast for future work, detailing both planned endeavors and those already in progress, to further expand on this research.\n\n\n","media":[],"title":"Ground Control to Major Threat - Hacking the Space Link Extension Protocol","type":{"conference_id":133,"conference":"DEFCON32","updated_at":"2024-07-21T19:20+0000","color":"#069622","name":"Creator Talk/Panel","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T19:20:45Z","id":46511},"end_tsz":"2024-08-09T23:00:00Z","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1723244400,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Space missions have increasingly been the subject in the context of security breaches and satellite hacks.

Instead, adversaries might shift their focus away from the Space Segment and opt for a more practical approach, such as accessing and exploiting the Ground Segment vulnerabilities and flaws in order to gain control over spacecraft. Every space mission comprises custom-made hardware and software components, which interact with each other utilizing dedicated protocols and standards designed and developed for this sole purpose. Numerous potential failure points can adversely impact a space mission, many of which persist on the ground. Considering the essential services they facilitate and the extent to which contemporary society relies on space technology, each component utilized in space missions should be regarded as integral to critical infrastructure and treated as such, particularly from a security standpoint. This study centers on the Space Link Extension (SLE) protocol, which is employed as a standard for communication between mission data systems and ground stations by various space agencies and organizations, including NASA and ESA. We will address the security concerns inherent in the SLE protocol. At the same time, we demonstrate methods and techniques malicious actors can employ to conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) or tap into the ground station communications, gaining control over an actual spacecraft. We will conclude this publication by presenting the reader with a possible mitigation strategy that we believe should be employed at the SLE protocol level. Additionally, we will outline a forecast for future work, detailing both planned endeavors and those already in progress, to further expand on this research.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720331870,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54578,54631],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54953,55005],"name":"Andrzej Olchawa","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrzejolchawa"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@0x4ndy)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://x.com/0x4ndy"},{"description":"","title":"andy.codes","sort_order":0,"url":"https://andy.codes"}],"media":[],"id":54248}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-09T22:30:00Z","timeband_id":1147,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-07T05:57:50Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-09T23:00:00.000-0000","id":54953,"tag_ids":[46169,46366,46419,46511,46736,46885],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723242600,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Demo 💻","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54248}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46257,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW4-04-02 (Creator Stage 3)","hotel":"","short_name":"HW4-04-02 (Creator Stage 3)","id":46381},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-09T22:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-07T05:57:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Years progress, time passes, and medical devices are still vulnerable, with Hospital computer and network security being a hot topic on the minds of citizens and CISA/FDA/etc. If we do not get better now, things will get much worse in the future.

Moreover, it features multiple modules, such as GitLab, SonarQube, and Azure DevOps.\nDuring this demonstration, I will present examples (based on real project experiences) of how to utilize Epyon for privilege escalation and lateral movement within a DevOps environment.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722207958,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[55486],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[55915],"name":"Victor Pasknel","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"pasknel","sort_order":0,"url":"https://pasknel"}],"media":[],"id":56018}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-09T22:10:00Z","timeband_id":1147,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-28T23:05:58Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-09T22:40:00.000-0000","id":55915,"tag_ids":[46169,46376,46511],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723241400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Demo 💻","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":2,"person_id":56018}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46255,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW2-09-01","hotel":"","short_name":"HW2-09-01","id":46343},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-09T22:10:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-28T23:05:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Curious about mobile phone privacy?

Unfortunately, it’s just not like it is portrayed in the Oceans franchise.. in real life there’s much less action, no George Clooney, and it’s a lot harder to pull off a heist than it seems.\n\nWell fortunately I’m not your typical hacker, I’m an AI hacker. I use adversarial machine learning techniques to disrupt, deceive and disclose information from Artificial Intelligence systems. I chose my target carefully: Canberra Casino. It’s the best casino in my city.. It’s also the only casino but that’s not the point.\n\nThe casino industry is at an interesting inflection point. Many large casinos have already adopted AI for surveillance and gameplay monitoring, smaller casinos are starting to make the transition, and there’s only a couple of companies in the world that provide this software. It’s ripe for exploitation.\n\nIn this talk I’m going to show you how I bypassed casino AI systems - facial recognition, surveillance systems and game monitoring. AI Security is the new cyber security threat, and attacks on AI systems could have broad implications including misdiagnoses in medical imaging, navigation errors in autonomous vehicles.. and successful casino heists.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722625241,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54612,54447,55880],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[56465,54820,54986],"name":"Harriet Farlow","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"Mileva Security Labs","title":"CEO"}],"pronouns":"she/her","links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/harriet-farlow-654963b7/"},{"description":"","title":"YouTube","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/@HarrietHacks"},{"description":"","title":"www.harriethacks.com/","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.harriethacks.com/"},{"description":"","title":"www.mileva.com.au/about-us","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.mileva.com.au/about-us"}],"media":[],"id":54195,"title":"CEO at Mileva Security Labs"}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-09T22:00:00Z","timeband_id":1147,"updated_tsz":"2024-08-02T19:00:41Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-09T23:00:00.000-0000","id":56465,"tag_ids":[46368,46511],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723240800,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":2,"person_id":54195}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46255,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW2-07-03","hotel":"","short_name":"HW2-07-03","id":46260},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-09T22:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-08-02T19:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"In this two-part presentation, we will explore the workings of trapped-ion quantum computers.

NSM-22 recognizes the changed risk landscape over the past decade and leverages the enhanced authorities of federal departments and agencies to implement a new risk management cycle that prioritizes collaborating with partners to identify and mitigate sector, cross-sector, and nationally significant risk.  The culmination of this cycle is the creation of the National Infrastructure Risk Management Plan (National Plan)—thereby replacing the 2013 National Infrastructure Protection Plan—and will guide the Federal effort to mitigate cross-sector and national risks to critical infrastructure.

NSM-22 recognizes the changed risk landscape over the past decade and leverages the enhanced authorities of federal departments and agencies to implement a new risk management cycle that prioritizes collaborating with partners to identify and mitigate sector, cross-sector, and nationally significant risk.  The culmination of this cycle is the creation of the National Infrastructure Risk Management Plan (National Plan)—thereby replacing the 2013 National Infrastructure Protection Plan—and will guide the Federal effort to mitigate cross-sector and national risks to critical infrastructure. As the National Coordinator for critical infrastructure security and resilience, CISA will develop this National Plan to be forward-looking and one that employs all available Federal tools, resources, and authorities to manage and reduce national-level risks, including those cascading across critical infrastructure sectors.

Fortunately for the entertainment value of this talk, there be dragons in our doors.  We will walk through some of the most high-profile attacks in detail and then dive into some more fundamental flaws with how the systems are designed.  All of these discussions will be accompanied with live demos and first hand experience.  After this talk, you will look at the world, especially doors, differently -- weaknesses everywhere!

We will highlight new areas that cloud researchers need to explore when hunting for cloud vulnerabilities and highlight best practices for developers to use in complex environments.\r\n\r\n- [link](https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/cloud-malware-cloudformation-injection/)\r\n- [link](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/pacu/wiki/Module-Details#cfn__resource_injection)\r\n- [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/)","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722098250,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54458],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54831],"name":"Yakir Kadkoda","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"Aqua","title":"Lead Security Researcher, Team Nautilus"}],"pronouns":"he/him","links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yakir-kadkoda/"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@YakirKad)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/YakirKad"},{"description":"","title":"www.aquasec.com/authors/yakir-kadkoda/","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.aquasec.com/authors/yakir-kadkoda/"}],"media":[],"id":54079,"title":"Lead Security Researcher, Team Nautilus at Aqua"},{"content_ids":[54458],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54831],"name":"Ofek Itach","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"Aqua","title":"Senior Security Researcher"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54092,"title":"Senior Security Researcher at Aqua"},{"content_ids":[54458],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54831],"name":"Michael Katchinskiy","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54202}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-09T21:30:00Z","timeband_id":1147,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-27T16:37:30Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-09T22:15:00.000-0000","id":54831,"tag_ids":[46166,46169,46419,46437,46438,46880],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723239000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Demo 💻, Exploit 🪲, Tool 🛠","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":2,"person_id":54079},{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":4,"person_id":54202},{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":6,"person_id":54092}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46254,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW1-11-03 (Track 3)","hotel":"","short_name":"HW1-11-03 (Track 3)","id":46302},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-09T21:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-27T16:37:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"The first 35 Veterans can receive a free autographed vopy of Mr Roccia's new book, Visual Threat Intelligence: An Illustrated Guide for Threat Researchers, courtesy of VETCON.\n\n\n","media":[],"title":"Book Signing: Visual Threat Intelligence: An Illustrated Guide for Threat Researchers","type":{"conference_id":133,"conference":"DEFCON32","updated_at":"2024-07-21T19:20+0000","color":"#069622","name":"Creator Talk/Panel","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T19:20:45Z","id":46511},"end_tsz":"2024-08-09T21:45:00Z","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1723239900,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"The first 35 Veterans can receive a free autographed vopy of Mr Roccia's new book, Visual Threat Intelligence: An Illustrated Guide for Threat Researchers, courtesy of VETCON.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1723225127,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54442,56209],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54815,56863],"name":"Thomas Roccia","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"Microsoft","title":"Senior Security Researcher"}],"pronouns":"he/him","links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-roccia/"},{"description":"","title":"Past Presentations","sort_order":0,"url":"https://speakerdeck.com/fr0gger"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@fr0gger_)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/fr0gger_"},{"description":"","title":"Website","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.securitybreak.io"}],"media":[],"id":54118,"title":"Senior Security Researcher at Microsoft"}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-09T21:00:00Z","timeband_id":1147,"updated_tsz":"2024-08-09T17:38:47Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-09T21:45:00.000-0000","id":56863,"tag_ids":[46409,46511],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723237200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":2,"person_id":54118}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46252,"name":"LVCC - L2 - W213-W214","hotel":"","short_name":"W213-W214","id":46286},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-09T21:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-08-09T17:38:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"This presentation delves into the geopolitical landscape of the United States and\nbeyond, providing a critical examination of the evolving societal attitudes toward democracy, globalism,\nand privacy.

With Tommyknocker, controls can be tested multiple times per day, ensuring that alerts are raised as soon as possible when a control ceases to function correctly, or is compromised by a threat actor.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1718922192,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54166],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54535],"name":"Jeremy Banker","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":53743}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-09T21:00:00Z","timeband_id":1147,"updated_tsz":"2024-06-20T22:23:12Z","links":[{"label":"Project","type":"link","url":"https://github.com/loredous/tommyknocker"},{"label":"DEF CON Forums","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/249615"}],"end":"2024-08-09T22:45:00.000-0000","id":54535,"tag_ids":[46169,46441,46445,46453,46455,46464,46465],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723237200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Demo 💻","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":2,"person_id":53743}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46253,"name":"LVCC - L3 - W303","hotel":"","short_name":"W303","id":46326},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-09T21:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-06-20T22:23:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"","media":[],"title":"Surprise Talk","type":{"conference_id":133,"conference":"DEFCON32","updated_at":"2024-07-21T19:20+0000","color":"#069622","name":"Creator Talk/Panel","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T19:20:45Z","id":46511},"end_tsz":"2024-08-09T20:45:00Z","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1723236300,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722991456,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54545,56160],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[56804,54920],"name":"Rachel Cummings","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"Columbia University","title":"Associate Professor of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54353,"title":"Associate Professor of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at Columbia University"}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-09T20:30:00Z","timeband_id":1147,"updated_tsz":"2024-08-07T00:44:16Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-09T20:45:00.000-0000","id":56804,"tag_ids":[46377,46511],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723235400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":2,"person_id":54353}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46255,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW2-09-02","hotel":"","short_name":"HW2-09-02","id":46263},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-09T20:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-08-07T00:44:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"En una actividad de simulación de adversarios, se demostró cómo se puede comprometer una empresa utilizando su antivirus corporativo.

Anyone interested in exploring the intersection of AI and code security analysis can attend this talk.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722457116,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[55737],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[56263],"name":"Wang Zhilong","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":56098},{"content_ids":[55737],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[56263],"name":"Xinzhi Luo","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":56099}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-09T20:15:00Z","timeband_id":1147,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-31T20:18:36Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-09T20:45:00.000-0000","id":56263,"tag_ids":[46370,46511],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723234500,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":1,"person_id":56098},{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":1,"person_id":56099}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46307,"name":"LVCC - L2 - W228-W230 - ASV Main Stage","hotel":"","short_name":"ASV Main Stage","id":46464},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-09T20:15:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-31T20:18:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"","media":[],"title":"Q&A With OWASP","type":{"conference_id":133,"conference":"DEFCON32","updated_at":"2024-07-21T19:20+0000","color":"#069622","name":"Creator Talk/Panel","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T19:20:45Z","id":46511},"end_tsz":"2024-08-09T22:00:00Z","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1723240800,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1723235175,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-09T20:00:00Z","timeband_id":1147,"updated_tsz":"2024-08-09T20:26:15Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-09T22:00:00.000-0000","id":56870,"tag_ids":[46370,46511],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723233600,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46307,"name":"LVCC - L2 - W228-W230 - ASV Pod 2","hotel":"","short_name":"ASV Pod 2","id":46467},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-09T20:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-08-09T20:26:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"","media":[],"title":"No CTF?

To showcase Caldera at DEF CON 32, we will present a scenario that a commercial or corporate entity may ask of a security team. In this scenario, a concerned organization is requesting a security team to develop a repeatable adversary emulation plan based on current cyber threat intelligence (CTI) for a specific advanced persistent threat (APT) that has been targeting the organization’s industry sector. We will create three cyber threat intelligence reports for this adversary detailing the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) attributed to them. These TTPs will correspond with the abilities available in Caldera’s Stockpile and Atomic plugins. This collection of abilities makes the job of developing an adversary emulation very simple. We will go on to demonstrate how to develop an adversary emulation plan in Caldera utilizing the relevant TTPs described in the CTI reporting.

This deep inspection capability of EDRs has led to an arms race with malware developers who want to evade EDRs while still achieving desired goals, such as code injection, lateral movement, and credential theft. This monitoring and evasion occurs in the lowest levels of hardware and software, including call stack frames, exception handlers, system calls, and manipulation of native instructions. Given this reality, EDRs are limited in how much lower they can operate to maintain an advantage. The success of EDR bypasses has led to their use in many high-profile attacks and by prolific ransomware groups.\r\n \r\nIn this talk, we discuss our research effort that led to the development of new memory forensics techniques for the detection of the bypasses that malware uses to evade EDRs. This includes bypass techniques, such as direct and indirect system calls, module overwriting, malicious exceptions handlers, and abuse of debug registers. Our developed capabilities were created as new plugins to the Volatility memory analysis framework, version 3, and will be released after the talk.\r\n\r\n1. “Operation Dragon Castling: APT group targeting betting companies,” [link](https://cymulate.com/threats/operation-dragon-castling-apt-group-targeting-betting-companies/), 2023.\r\n2. “Defeating Guloader Anti-Analysis Technique,” [link](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/guloader-variant-anti-analysis/), 2023.\r\n3. “A Deep Dive Into ALPHV/BlackCat Ransomware,” [link](https://securityscorecard.com/research/deep-dive-into-alphv-blackcat-ransomware/), 2024.\r\n4. “APT Operation Skeleton Key,” [link](https://cycraft.com/download/CyCraft-Whitepaper-Chimera%20V4.1.pdf), 2023.\r\n5. “LockBit Ransomware Side-loads Cobalt Strike Beacon with Legitimate VMware Utility,” [link](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/lockbit-ransomware-side-loads-cobalt-strike-beacon-with-legitimate-vmware-utility/), 2024.19\r\n6. “BlueBravo Uses Ambassador Lure to Deploy,” [link](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-0127.pdf), 2024.\r\n7. “UNMASKING THE DARK ART OF VECTORED EXCEPTION HANDLING: BYPASSING XDR AND EDR IN THE EVOLVING CYBER THREAT LANDSCAPE,” [link](https://blackhatmea.com/session/unmasking-dark-art-vectored-exception-handling-bypassing-xdr-and-edr-evolving-cyber-threat), 2023.\r\n8. “Dirty Vanity: A New Approach to Code injection & EDR by-pass,” [link](https://i.blackhat.com/EU-22/Thursday-Briefings/EU-22-Nissan-DirtyVanity.pdf), 2022.\r\n9.

This deep inspection capability of EDRs has led to an arms race with malware developers who want to evade EDRs while still achieving desired goals, such as code injection, lateral movement, and credential theft. This monitoring and evasion occurs in the lowest levels of hardware and software, including call stack frames, exception handlers, system calls, and manipulation of native instructions. Given this reality, EDRs are limited in how much lower they can operate to maintain an advantage. The success of EDR bypasses has led to their use in many high-profile attacks and by prolific ransomware groups.\r\n \r\nIn this talk, we discuss our research effort that led to the development of new memory forensics techniques for the detection of the bypasses that malware uses to evade EDRs. This includes bypass techniques, such as direct and indirect system calls, module overwriting, malicious exceptions handlers, and abuse of debug registers. Our developed capabilities were created as new plugins to the Volatility memory analysis framework, version 3, and will be released after the talk.\r\n\r\n1. “Operation Dragon Castling: APT group targeting betting companies,” [link](https://cymulate.com/threats/operation-dragon-castling-apt-group-targeting-betting-companies/), 2023.\r\n2. “Defeating Guloader Anti-Analysis Technique,” [link](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/guloader-variant-anti-analysis/), 2023.\r\n3. “A Deep Dive Into ALPHV/BlackCat Ransomware,” [link](https://securityscorecard.com/research/deep-dive-into-alphv-blackcat-ransomware/), 2024.\r\n4. “APT Operation Skeleton Key,” [link](https://cycraft.com/download/CyCraft-Whitepaper-Chimera%20V4.1.pdf), 2023.\r\n5. “LockBit Ransomware Side-loads Cobalt Strike Beacon with Legitimate VMware Utility,” [link](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/lockbit-ransomware-side-loads-cobalt-strike-beacon-with-legitimate-vmware-utility/), 2024.19\r\n6. “BlueBravo Uses Ambassador Lure to Deploy,” [link](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-0127.pdf), 2024.\r\n7. “UNMASKING THE DARK ART OF VECTORED EXCEPTION HANDLING: BYPASSING XDR AND EDR IN THE EVOLVING CYBER THREAT LANDSCAPE,” [link](https://blackhatmea.com/session/unmasking-dark-art-vectored-exception-handling-bypassing-xdr-and-edr-evolving-cyber-threat), 2023.\r\n8. “Dirty Vanity: A New Approach to Code injection & EDR by-pass,” [link](https://i.blackhat.com/EU-22/Thursday-Briefings/EU-22-Nissan-DirtyVanity.pdf), 2022.\r\n9.

This makes it a perfect candidate to build a WHOIS dataset, review historic WHOIS records, and alert you on fresh enterprise domains. We will demo all this and more!","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722633248,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[55898],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[56485],"name":"Willis Vandevanter","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":56265}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-09T19:05:00Z","timeband_id":1147,"updated_tsz":"2024-08-02T21:14:08Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-09T19:40:00.000-0000","id":56485,"tag_ids":[46391,46511],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723230300,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":2,"person_id":56265}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46257,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW4-03-04","hotel":"","short_name":"HW4-03-04","id":46371},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-09T19:05:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-08-02T21:14:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"","media":[],"title":"Bridging the Gap: How the American Legion Provides Veterans with a Sense of Belonging and Support","type":{"conference_id":133,"conference":"DEFCON32","updated_at":"2024-07-21T19:20+0000","color":"#069622","name":"Creator Talk/Panel","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T19:20:45Z","id":46511},"end_tsz":"2024-08-09T19:45:00Z","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1723232700,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1723225098,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[56207],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[56861],"name":"Chris Davis","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":56599}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-09T19:00:00Z","timeband_id":1147,"updated_tsz":"2024-08-09T17:38:18Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-09T19:45:00.000-0000","id":56861,"tag_ids":[46409,46511],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723230000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":2,"person_id":56599}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46252,"name":"LVCC - L2 - W213-W214","hotel":"","short_name":"W213-W214","id":46286},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-09T19:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-08-09T17:38:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Welcome to the Gold Bug at the 11th annual Crypto & Privacy Village!

It does not cover analysis of the artifacts, but will cover how to collect data from an Android device (and the limitations) using Free and Open Source tools.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722462516,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[55755],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[56280],"name":"Omenscan","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":56136}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-09T18:45:00Z","timeband_id":1147,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-31T21:48:36Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-09T20:30:00.000-0000","id":56280,"tag_ids":[46373,46734],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723229100,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":1,"person_id":56136}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46253,"name":"LVCC - L3 - W309 (BTV Track 2 Workshops)","hotel":"","short_name":"W309 (BTV Track 2 Workshops)","id":46473},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-09T18:45:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-31T21:48:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Explore the intricacies of time-based SQL injection through the lens of Operation GhostShell.

Beyond the technical background, there is a story to tell here, to capitalize on what went wrong and what we could improve.\r\n\r\n- OSS Security Andres Freund Email: [link](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4)\r\n- My work on the XZ Backdoor: [link](https://x.com/fr0gger_/status/1774342248437813525)\r\n- Second tweet of the XZ Backdoor: [link](https://x.com/fr0gger_/status/1775759514249445565)\r\n- Additional works related to my presentation:\r\n    - Gynvael Coldwind: [link](https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?lang=en&id=782)\r\n    - [link](https://gist.github.com/thesamesam/223949d5a074ebc3dce9ee78baad9e27) by @thesamesam@social.treehouse.systems\r\n    - [link](https://boehs.org/node/everything-i-know-about-the-xz-backdoor) by @eb@social.coop\r\n    - [link](https://wiz.io/blog/cve-2024-3094-critical-rce-vulnerability-found-in-xz-utils) by @wiz_io\r\n    - [link](https://gist.github.com/smx-smx/a6112d54777845d389bd7126d6e9f504) by smx\r\n    - [link](https://securelist.com/xz-backdoor-story-part-1/112354/) by Kaspersky\r\n    - [link](https://github.com/blasty/JiaTansSSHAgent) by @bl4sty","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720461930,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54442,56209],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54815,56863],"name":"Thomas Roccia","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"Microsoft","title":"Senior Security Researcher"}],"pronouns":"he/him","links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-roccia/"},{"description":"","title":"Past Presentations","sort_order":0,"url":"https://speakerdeck.com/fr0gger"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@fr0gger_)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/fr0gger_"},{"description":"","title":"Website","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.securitybreak.io"}],"media":[],"id":54118,"title":"Senior Security Researcher at Microsoft"}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-09T18:00:00Z","timeband_id":1147,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-08T18:05:30Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-09T18:45:00.000-0000","id":54815,"tag_ids":[46166,46169,46419,46882],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723226400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Demo 💻","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54118}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46253,"name":"LVCC - L3 - W322-W327 (Warstories Track)","hotel":"","short_name":"W322-W327 (Warstories Track)","id":46314},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-09T18:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-08T18:05:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"We all know it all too well: that ominous feeling when opening an unknown file in your favorite analysis tool, only to be greeted with hundreds or thousands of unknown functions, none of which are matched by your existing function signatures, nor any of your helper scripts.

Starting with the C2 infrastructure we set up for the attack, we will guide the audience through the kill chain in chronological order and highlight the most important and relevant steps of the attack.\r\n\r\nOnce the offensive part of the talk concludes, a shift of perspective takes place and the attack is evaluated from the defence's point-of-view: we'll show how we identified, secured and analyzed indicators of compromise left behind by the attack. This includes the analysis of network captures, Windows event logs, memory dumps and more.\r\n\r\nThis talk will be presented by not only people from NVISO as the IT security service provider who built the firing range and performed to attack against it, but also by people from VERBUND's IT security team who actively use the firing range for training. This way we can involve both the attacker's and the defence's point-of-view.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720393612,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54549],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54924],"name":"Julia Dewitz-Würzelberger","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"VERBUND","title":"Project Manager, OT Cyber Security"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54661,"title":"Project Manager, OT Cyber Security at VERBUND"},{"content_ids":[54549],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54924],"name":"Bernhard Sedlmayer","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":56027},{"content_ids":[54549],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54924],"name":"Sarah Mader","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"NVISO","title":"Senior Consultant"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":56028,"title":"Senior Consultant at NVISO"}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-09T17:30:00Z","timeband_id":1147,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-07T23:06:52Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-09T18:00:00.000-0000","id":54924,"tag_ids":[46169,46382,46419,46511,46736,46884],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723224600,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Demo 💻","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":2,"person_id":54661},{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":4,"person_id":56027},{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":6,"person_id":56028}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46256,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW3-06-02 (Creator Stage 2)","hotel":"","short_name":"HW3-06-02 (Creator Stage 2)","id":46346},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-09T17:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-07T23:06:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Join General Paul M.

Specifically, I'll give an overview of how we engage with theft victims to surveil, track, identify, and take down transnational black market bike fences - who often turn out to be even crazier individuals than anybody ever expected.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722633248,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[55893],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[56480],"name":"Bryan Hance","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":56262}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-09T17:00:00Z","timeband_id":1147,"updated_tsz":"2024-08-02T21:14:08Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-09T17:45:00.000-0000","id":56480,"tag_ids":[46391,46511],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723222800,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":2,"person_id":56262}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46257,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW4-03-04","hotel":"","short_name":"HW4-03-04","id":46371},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-09T17:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-08-02T21:14:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Join us at the AI Village for interactive demonstrations at the intersection of AI and security.

Various levels of self-driving functionalities, such as AI-powered perception, sensor fusion and route planning, are entering the product portfolio of automobile companies. From the security perspective, these AI-powered components not only contain common security problems such as memory safety bugs, but also introduce new threats such as physical adversarial attacks and sensor manipulations. Two popular examples of physical adversarial attacks are camouflage stickers that interfere with vehicle detection systems, and road graffitis that disturb lane keeping systems. The AI-powered navigation and control relies on the fusion of multiple sensor inputs, and many of the sensor inputs can be manipulated by malicious attackers. These manipulations combined with logical bugs in autonomous driving systems pose severe threats to road safety.\r\n\r\nWe design autonomous driving CTF (AutoDriving CTF) contests around the security challenges specific to these self-driving functions and components.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the AutoDriving CTF are the followings:\r\n\r\n- Demonstrate security implications of autonomous driving system design decisions through hands-on challenges, increase the awareness of potential risks in security professionals, and encourage them to propose defense solutions and tools to detect such risks.\r\n- Provide CTF challenges that allow players to learn attack and defense practices related to autonomous driving in a well-controlled, repeatable, and visible environment.\r\n- Build a set of vulnerable autonomous driving components that can be used for security research and defense evaluation.\r\n\r\nThe contest is based on a Jeopardy style of CTF game with a set of independent challenges. A typical contest challenge includes a backend that runs autonomous driving components in simulated or real environments, and a frontend that interacts with the players. This year's contest will follow the style of last year and includes the following types of challenges:\r\n\r\n- “attack”: such as constructing adversarial patches and spoofing fake sensor inputs,\r\n- “forensics”: such as investigating a security incident related to autonomous driving,\r\n- “detection”: such as detecting spoofed sensor inputs and fake obstacles,\r\n- “crashme on road!”: such as creating dangerous traffic scenarios to expose logical errors in autonomous driving systems.\r\n- “smart planner”: such as creating intelligent path planners for dangerous tasks that are difficult for human drivers\r\n\r\nMost of these challenges will be developed using game-engine based autonomous driving simulators, such as CARLA and SVL. The following link contains some challenge videos, summaries from AutoDriving CTF at DEF CON 29 and DEF CON 30\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JSVarIaQBmseLC9XqkfrxnRQto4WM225?usp=sharing\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPPsKbVpxwk-464KIzr8xKw\r\n\r\n# What's new in 2024\r\nThis year, we will unlock new traffic conflict scenarios that are observed from real-world driving logs such as Jaywalk and double parked vehicles. New difficulty levels will be added to challenges in such scenarios by integrating real downstream AI modules such as object tracking from open-source autonomous driving software like Apollo, Autoware and OpenPilot.\r\n\r\nIn order to enable the audience to experience the challenges more directly, we plan to set up a vehicle wheel controller on site and provide a driving game this year. Audiences can drive themselves to compete with the self-driving vehicle in some of the challenges. Driving game demo:\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LIzJJ1I3Eqj_e0_ntX5eFu82U9ObiEYB?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n# For players\r\n- What do players need to do to participate AutoDriving CTF?\r\nMost of the challenges do not require domain knowledge of autonomous driving software or adversarial machine learning, although knowledge of those helps. For example, the players can generate images the way they like (e.g., drawing, photoshopping) to fool the AI-components or write a short python script to control the vehicle. Some challenges, such as incident forensics likely would require players to learn domain knowledge such as sensor information format and how fusion works.\r\n\r\n- What do we expect players to learn through the CTF event?\r\nPlayers can (1) gain a deep understanding of real-world autonomous driving systems' design, implementation, and their corresponding security properties and characteristics; and (2) learn the attack and defense practices related to autonomous driving in a well-controlled, repeatable, visible, and engaging environment.\n\n\n","media":[{"hash_sha256":"375569510e5615465450cb3678a63b8069acd85e1636cca316295fc89cf599d6","filetype":"image/png","hash_md5":"06d063cea5818c71eee33a32d18b836d","name":"ct_autodriving.png","is_logo":"Y","hash_crc32c":"db78dfca","filesize":20241,"asset_id":624,"sort_order":1,"url":"https://info.defcon.org/blobs/ct_autodriving.png"}],"title":"[CANCELED] AutoDriving CTF","type":{"conference_id":133,"conference":"DEFCON32","updated_at":"2024-07-21T19:20+0000","color":"#904807","name":"Contest","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T19:20:45Z","id":46439},"end_tsz":"2024-08-11T01:00:00Z","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1723338000,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"The AutoDriving CTF contest focuses on the emerging security challenges in autonomous driving systems.

A typical contest challenge includes a backend that runs autonomous driving components in simulated or real environments, and a frontend that interacts with the players. This year's contest will follow the style of last year and includes the following types of challenges:\r\n\r\n- “attack”: such as constructing adversarial patches and spoofing fake sensor inputs,\r\n- “forensics”: such as investigating a security incident related to autonomous driving,\r\n- “detection”: such as detecting spoofed sensor inputs and fake obstacles,\r\n- “crashme on road!”: such as creating dangerous traffic scenarios to expose logical errors in autonomous driving systems.\r\n- “smart planner”: such as creating intelligent path planners for dangerous tasks that are difficult for human drivers\r\n\r\nMost of these challenges will be developed using game-engine based autonomous driving simulators, such as CARLA and SVL.

Post the audio to the TeleChallenge voice BBS challenging up to three others using their phone number, or post a video to https://defcon.social or your social media of choice using the hashtag #HackerCoolingContraption and the following:\r\n  - Your handle\r\n  - Who challenged you\r\n  - A statement of acceptance (\"I agree that I am responsible for my own hacker cooling actions, I understand that water is wet, and I promise not to sue the TeleChallenge or DEF CON\" or something to that effect)\r\n  - The handles of 3 people you are nominating\r\n  - A link to a nonprofit cancer research project or charity of your choice that you have chosen to support\r\n  - A mention of your contribution (including cash, cryptocurrency, volunteer hours, or computing resources), if any\r\n\r\nSuggested: Make a contribution of your choice to support cancer research. You may want to check nonprofit and charity quality here: https://www.charitynavigator.org/\r\n\r\nRULES\r\n\r\n1. You can use up to 4 items obtained either from the TeleChallenge booth or at a dollar store costing no more than $5 plus tax, plus duct tape, along with a single one-gallon bucket or container full of conventional ice and water (solely H2O!) to build your Contraption.\r\n2. Only hand tools may be used.\r\n3. No hackers may be harmed in the execution of the Challenge. Contraption may cool to no colder than -3 degrees Celcius.\r\n4. You may wear no less than a bathing suit (due to dress code requirements at pools).\r\n5. Contraptions will be judged only for full participants of the Challenge, meaning you have made three nominations and at least two nominees have also participated.\r\n6. Judging criteria: Efficacy, creativity, flair, hax.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722309155,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-09T17:00:00Z","timeband_id":1147,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-30T03:12:35Z","links":[{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/249290"},{"label":"More Info","type":"link","url":"https://www.telechallenge.org"},{"label":"Sub-forum (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/249289"}],"end":"2024-08-10T01:00:00.000-0000","id":56012,"tag_ids":[46426,46439,46770],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723222800,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46257,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW4-02-02-B","hotel":"","short_name":"HW4-02-02-B","id":46363},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-09T17:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-30T03:12:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Friday: Free play 10:00 - 15:00, \r\nPrelim Round 1: 16:00 - 17:00, \r\nPrelim Round 2: 17:00 - 18:00, \r\nRegistration closes: 18:00\r\n\r\nSaturday: Prelim Round 3: 11:00, \r\nPrelim Round 4: 12:00,\r\nSemi Finals Round 1: 14:00,\r\nSemi Finals Round 2: 15:00,\r\nFinals: 17:00\r\n\r\nHackFortress is a unique blend of Team Fortress 2 and a computer security contest.

Ideally visitors to our contest area will participate in the CTF allowing them to get a better understanding of telecom hacking in the year 2024 as well as a respect for the art of phreaking from yesteryears.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722307355,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-09T17:00:00Z","timeband_id":1147,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-30T02:42:35Z","links":[{"label":"Twitter (@mainframed767)","type":"link","url":"https://twitter.com/mainframed767"},{"label":"Sub-forum (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/249310"},{"label":"Twitter (@HackedExistence)","type":"link","url":"https://twitter.com/HackedExistence"},{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/249311"}],"end":"2024-08-10T01:00:00.000-0000","id":55975,"tag_ids":[46426,46439,46784],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723222800,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46257,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW4-02-02-C","hotel":"","short_name":"HW4-02-02-C","id":46364},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-09T17:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-30T02:42:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"The inaugural Pinball High Score contest at DEF CON will run  Friday and Saturday: 10:00-18:00, Sunday 10:00-13:00 with games available for daily High Score contests, daily challenges and open qualifying for a main tournament.

Participants compete against each other on both real and simulated medical devices, integrated into the fully immersive Biohacking Village: Device Lab, laid out as a working hospital. \r\n\r\nChallenges will be tailored for all skill levels and draw from expertise areas including forensics, RF hacking, network exploitation techniques, web security, protocol reverse engineering, hardware hacking, and others. You will hack actual medical devices and play with protocols like DICOM, HL7 and FHIR.\r\n\r\n# 2024 Capture the Flag Challenge\r\n\r\nWelcome, elite hackers and cyber sleuths, to a CTF experience like no other - the \"Code D.A.R.K. : Biohacking Village CTF Challenge\".\r\n \r\nMerge the worlds of biology and cybersecurity in an adrenaline-pumping contest that tests your skills in ways you've never imagined. Thrilling and challenging cybersecurity adventure centered around a hospital setting as a scenario where participants engage in a race against time to secure or retrieve critical medical data, navigating through various cybersecurity puzzles and challenges, where participants act as guardians of critical biological data. \r\n\r\nUnravel Biological Mysteries: Dive into a narrative where biotechnology meets cyber-warfare. Decode genetic puzzles, breach virtual lab networks, and outsmart bioinformatics security systems.\r\n\r\nElevate Your Hacking Game: Challenge yourself with unique biocybersecurity scenarios. This isn't your typical CTF - it's a fusion of biotech intrigue and hardcore hacking.\r\n\r\nCompete and Collaborate: Team up with fellow biohackers and cyber warriors. Share knowledge, strategize, and show off your skills in a community where biology and bits intersect.\r\n\r\nGear Up for a Cyber-Biotech Showdown\r\n\r\nImmersive Scenarios: Each challenge is a step into a world where safeguarding biological data is as critical as securing digital assets.\r\n\r\nSkill Diversity: Whether you're a veteran hacker or a biotech enthusiast, Code D.A.R.K. offers a range of puzzles that cater to a wide array of skills and interests.\r\n\r\n - OT/IT\r\n - Medical devices\r\n - Hospital infrastructure\r\n - Regulatory and international affairs\r\n - Robotics\r\n - Data\r\n - **Mark your calendars** and set your alarms because the action kicks off on Friday, August 9th at 1000 PDT.\r\n - **Play from anywhere in the world!** CTF open hours are as follows: \r\n   -   Friday, August 9th from 10am PST - 6pm PDT\r\n   -   Saturday, August 10th from 10am PST - 6pm PDT\r\n   -   Sunday, August 11th from 10am PST - 12pm PDT\r\n\r\n# RULES\r\n\r\n## REGISTRATION\r\n\r\nParticipants may only register once for this challenge. If participants register for this challenge more than once, the whole teams with a participant that registered multiple times will be disqualified.\r\n\r\nBy registering, participants agree that their accounts may be rejected or terminated and all submissions by them and/or their Team may be disqualified if any of the information in their account is incorrect.\r\n\r\nParticipants must agree to and abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://www.villageb.io/code-of-conduct) while participating in the Biohacking Village Capture the Flag. Anyone who will conduct themselves against the CoC will be eliminated from competition and banned forever.\r\n\r\n## TEAMS\r\n\r\nAfter participants register individually, they may work alone (team of one) or on one team with other challenge participants. To work on a team, they may either create a new team or join one that is pre-existing ( if a participant wishes to join a team or offer others to join, they can do so in the #ctf-st-elvis-teambuilding Discord Channel)\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of team members is five (5).\r\n\r\nAll teams must designate a Team Captain. A Team Captain serves as the official contact person for a team: this person should provide accurate and complete contact information to ensure that CTF organizers can reach their team if needed.\r\n\r\nEach member of the team must be a registered participant in the CTF.\r\n\r\nIf participants choose to join a team, then they may not simultaneously participate as an individual or another team. \r\n\r\n## CHALLENGE SUBMISSIONS\r\n\r\nAll submissions must be received during the Challenge period. Submissions posted after the posted time frame will be disqualified.\r\n\r\nParticipants may get an answer but it will forfeit their points for that challenge. Even if the flag they tried before was similar.

Participants compete against each other on both real and simulated medical devices, integrated into the fully immersive Biohacking Village: Device Lab, laid out as a working hospital. \r\n\r\nChallenges will be tailored for all skill levels and draw from expertise areas including forensics, RF hacking, network exploitation techniques, web security, protocol reverse engineering, hardware hacking, and others. You will hack actual medical devices and play with protocols like DICOM, HL7 and FHIR.\r\n\r\n# 2024 Capture the Flag Challenge\r\n\r\nWelcome, elite hackers and cyber sleuths, to a CTF experience like no other - the \"Code D.A.R.K. : Biohacking Village CTF Challenge\".\r\n \r\nMerge the worlds of biology and cybersecurity in an adrenaline-pumping contest that tests your skills in ways you've never imagined. Thrilling and challenging cybersecurity adventure centered around a hospital setting as a scenario where participants engage in a race against time to secure or retrieve critical medical data, navigating through various cybersecurity puzzles and challenges, where participants act as guardians of critical biological data. \r\n\r\nUnravel Biological Mysteries: Dive into a narrative where biotechnology meets cyber-warfare. Decode genetic puzzles, breach virtual lab networks, and outsmart bioinformatics security systems.\r\n\r\nElevate Your Hacking Game: Challenge yourself with unique biocybersecurity scenarios. This isn't your typical CTF - it's a fusion of biotech intrigue and hardcore hacking.\r\n\r\nCompete and Collaborate: Team up with fellow biohackers and cyber warriors. Share knowledge, strategize, and show off your skills in a community where biology and bits intersect.\r\n\r\nGear Up for a Cyber-Biotech Showdown\r\n\r\nImmersive Scenarios: Each challenge is a step into a world where safeguarding biological data is as critical as securing digital assets.\r\n\r\nSkill Diversity: Whether you're a veteran hacker or a biotech enthusiast, Code D.A.R.K. offers a range of puzzles that cater to a wide array of skills and interests.\r\n\r\n - OT/IT\r\n - Medical devices\r\n - Hospital infrastructure\r\n - Regulatory and international affairs\r\n - Robotics\r\n - Data\r\n - **Mark your calendars** and set your alarms because the action kicks off on Friday, August 9th at 1000 PDT.\r\n - **Play from anywhere in the world!** CTF open hours are as follows: \r\n   -   Friday, August 9th from 10am PST - 6pm PDT\r\n   -   Saturday, August 10th from 10am PST - 6pm PDT\r\n   -   Sunday, August 11th from 10am PST - 12pm PDT\r\n\r\n# RULES\r\n\r\n## REGISTRATION\r\n\r\nParticipants may only register once for this challenge. If participants register for this challenge more than once, the whole teams with a participant that registered multiple times will be disqualified.\r\n\r\nBy registering, participants agree that their accounts may be rejected or terminated and all submissions by them and/or their Team may be disqualified if any of the information in their account is incorrect.\r\n\r\nParticipants must agree to and abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://www.villageb.io/code-of-conduct) while participating in the Biohacking Village Capture the Flag. Anyone who will conduct themselves against the CoC will be eliminated from competition and banned forever.\r\n\r\n## TEAMS\r\n\r\nAfter participants register individually, they may work alone (team of one) or on one team with other challenge participants. To work on a team, they may either create a new team or join one that is pre-existing ( if a participant wishes to join a team or offer others to join, they can do so in the #ctf-st-elvis-teambuilding Discord Channel)\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of team members is five (5).\r\n\r\nAll teams must designate a Team Captain. A Team Captain serves as the official contact person for a team: this person should provide accurate and complete contact information to ensure that CTF organizers can reach their team if needed.\r\n\r\nEach member of the team must be a registered participant in the CTF.\r\n\r\nIf participants choose to join a team, then they may not simultaneously participate as an individual or another team. \r\n\r\n## CHALLENGE SUBMISSIONS\r\n\r\nAll submissions must be received during the Challenge period. Submissions posted after the posted time frame will be disqualified.\r\n\r\nParticipants may get an answer but it will forfeit their points for that challenge. Even if the flag they tried before was similar. The decision to get the answer is final for zero points.\r\n\r\n## CHALLENGE SCORING\r\n\r\nEach submission has set value known beforehand in the challenge description\r\n\r\nThe winning teams will be decided based on the number of the accumulated points during the CTF timeframe. In case two teams accumulate the same amount of points, the team that reached the amount of points in question faster will be the winner.\r\n\r\n## CHALLENGE DISQUALIFICATION\r\n\r\nWhole team gets disqualified if any of the following applies:\r\n\r\n - One or multiple team members have registered more than once\r\n - One or multiple team members will not follow [Code of Conduct](https://www.villageb.io/code-of-conduct) (applies to any of the Biohacking village platforms or social media)\r\n - Any offensive behaviour such as attacking the Biohacking Village infrastructure, denial of service, or escaping the boundaries set by the CTF or Device Lab environment\r\n\r\n## PRIVACY\r\n\r\nUnless stated otherwise on the mainsite, we do not share any information about participants with anyone.

These systems exist at the intersection of hardware and software, built to accomplish a specific task. However, unlike general-purpose computers, embedded systems are typically designed for a particular case of use and have limited resources. This makes them both challenging and fascinating to work with, especially from a security perspective. Often these disciplines are dealt with individually, but understanding the custom relationships between hardware and software is vital to performing security research on these devices.\r\n\r\nThe embedded device CTF contest is an exciting opportunity to explore the intricacies of these systems and test your skills in a competitive environment. Contestants are challenged to find vulnerabilities in the firmware or hardware and exploit them to gain access or control over the device. The contest offers a unique opportunity to explore embedded devices' inner workings and understand their design's security implications.\r\n\r\nNew devices will be dramatically introduced at set intervals throughout the competition, and point values will decrease over time. This keeps contestants guessing and on their toes, forcing them to adapt and use their skills to tackle new challenges. It also offers a chance to learn about different types of devices and how they function, broadening participants' knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\nBy participating in the contest, contestants can develop a deep understanding of how these systems operate and how to secure them against potential attacks. Additionally, the contest encourages participants to think outside the box and approach problems creatively, honing their problem-solving skills. The competition provides a valuable opportunity to network with like-minded individuals and a chance to learn from others in the field hands-on.\r\n\r\nOverall, the embedded device CTF contest is an exciting and educational experience that showcases the unique challenges and rewards of working with embedded devices. With the rise of the Internet of Things and the increasing integration of technology in our daily lives, embedded devices are becoming more ubiquitous, making this contest relevant and worth checking out. Whether you're a seasoned security professional or just starting in the field, the contest offers a chance to learn, test your skills, and have fun in a dynamic and competitive environment.\r\n\r\nThis is the main event at Embedded Systems Village.  Come and show off your skills at hacking our collection of vulnerable embedded devices and find flags to score points!

These systems exist at the intersection of hardware and software, built to accomplish a specific task. However, unlike general-purpose computers, embedded systems are typically designed for a particular case of use and have limited resources. This makes them both challenging and fascinating to work with, especially from a security perspective. Often these disciplines are dealt with individually, but understanding the custom relationships between hardware and software is vital to performing security research on these devices.\r\n\r\nThe embedded device CTF contest is an exciting opportunity to explore the intricacies of these systems and test your skills in a competitive environment. Contestants are challenged to find vulnerabilities in the firmware or hardware and exploit them to gain access or control over the device.

These bugs are possible to be triggered whenever within the same virtual space as a malicious user and represent a new attack surface not previously available. This research culminates in triggering a novel vulnerability in libovravatar2p.so which allows remote memory corruption and represents the building blocks for RCE across the metaverse.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720331869,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54548],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54923],"name":"Luke McLaren","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"Signal 11 Research Ltd","title":"Founder"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54268,"title":"Founder at Signal 11 Research Ltd"}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-09T17:00:00Z","timeband_id":1147,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-07T05:57:49Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-09T18:00:00.000-0000","id":54923,"tag_ids":[46397,46419,46437,46511,46736,46885],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723222800,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Exploit 🪲","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54268}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":46257,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW4-04-02 (Creator Stage 3)","hotel":"","short_name":"HW4-04-02 (Creator Stage 3)","id":46381},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-09T17:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-07T05:57:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"The talk \"Practical Exploitation of DoS in Bug Bounty\" explains methods for identifying and exploiting Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities in bug bounty programs.

However, this footage has \"blind spots\", areas where objects are detected with lower confidence due to their angle/distance from the camera.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we investigate a novel side effect of object detection in CCTV footage; location-based confidence weakness.\r\n\r\nWe demonstrate that a pedestrian's position (distance, angle, height) in footage impacts an object detector's confidence.\r\n\r\nWe analyze this phenomenon in four lighting conditions (lab, morning, afternoon, night) using five object detectors (YOLOv3, Faster R-CNN, SSD, DiffusionDet, RTMDet).\r\n\r\nWe then demonstrate this in footage of pedestrian traffic from three locations (Broadway, Shibuya Crossing, Castro Street), showing they contain \"blind spots\" where pedestrians are detected with low confidence. This persists across various locations, object detectors, and times of day. A malicious actor could take advantage of this to avoid detection.\r\n\r\nWe propose TipToe, a novel evasion attack leveraging \"blind spots\" to construct a minimum confidence path between two points in a CCTV-recorded area.\r\nWe demonstrate its performance on footage of Broadway, Shibuya Crossing, and Castro Street, observed by YOLOv3, Faster R-CNN, SSD, DiffusionDet, and RTMDet.\r\n\r\nTipToe reduces max/average confidence by 0.10 and 0.16, respectively, on paths in Shibuya Crossing observed by YOLOv3, with similar performance for other locations and object detectors.\r\n\r\n1.

When you install, run, use, or hack a system, you will always use DLL. This DLL mechanism has been exploited for several years for malware development through several techniques : DLL injection, DLL sideloading, Reflective DLL but do you really know how Windows is loading a DLL ? Do you know how it links all sections ? Which structures are used to store internally ? How does it resolve dependencies ? And are you able to design your own Perfect DLL Loader that fully integrate with the WIN32API? \nIn this workshop, you will lose you sanity and dive into the Windows DLL mechanism.

Please be patient. All of the times listed here are **approximate**. \r\n\r\n# Basics\r\n\r\n### Who needs a badge?\r\n\r\nA badge is required for each human age 8 and older.\r\n\r\n### Human?\r\n\r\nYou are a human if you do not know otherwise. People that are not humans include goons, official speaker, village/community/contest/creator staff, press, black badge holders, or similar. If you are not a human, you need to register separately. If you don't know how, see an NFO goon (NFO Node, formerly known as an infobooth, is where you can get help). The remainder of this message applies only to humans.\r\n\r\n### Lines? Linecon?\r\n\r\nLinecon is your optional opportunity to stand (or sit) in line for human registration to open. Doors will open for linecon on Wednesday at approximately 17:00. When human registration opens on Thursday at approximately 08:00, they start working the linecon queue, and the line will start moving quickly. (Please understand that we will begin processing the line on Thursday morning as soon as the cashiers and materials are in place; we will strive for Thursday 08:00, but actual start may be slightly earlier or later.)\r\n\r\nOnline badge purchase (aka pre-registration) has no impact on linecon. You can join the line on Wednesday (if you wish) regardless of whether you purchased a badge online or intend to pay with cash. There is only one linecon for both types of badge sales. \r\n\r\nPlease help us make this a great experience for everyone by **following directions given by goons**. After human registration opens, there may be one line for all of registration, or there may be two lines (one for online sales (pre-registration) and one for cash sales). This may also change over time, based on available staffing and necessary crowd control. We will strive to make it easily understandable in-person as to which line you should join. \r\n\r\n# Ways to buy a badge\r\n\r\n- $480 [online purchase](https://shop.defcon.org/products/def-con-32-las-vegas-convention-center) until August 1, 2024. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.\r\n- $460 cash purchase on-site.\r\n- As part of a BlackHat registration.\r\n\r\n### Online Purchase\r\n\r\nYou will be emailed a QR code to the email address provided when you bought your badge. Please guard that QR code as though it is cash -- it can only be redeemed once, and anyone can redeem it if they have it (including a photo of it). Badges are picked-up on-site -- they will not be mailed or shipped.\r\n\r\nWe can scan the QR code either from your phone's display or from a printed copy. You **must** have the QR code with you in order to obtain your badge. As you approach the front of the line, if you are going to show your QR code on an electronic device, please ensure that your display is set to maximum brightness. \r\n\r\nIf you pre-registered, but ultimately are unable to attend DEF CON and want to cancel your purchase, the **only** way to get a refund is from the original online source. We are unable to provide any refunds on-site at DEF CON. There is a fee to have your badge canceled: $34 until July 15, and $84 on and after July 15.\r\n\r\nOnline purchases are provided a receipt via email when the purchase is made.\r\n\r\nOnline purchase -- often referred to as pre-registration -- does not allow you to skip any line/queue to pick up your badge. Once you arrive on-site, you will need to join the existing line for human registration. There may or may not be a dedicated line for pre-registration badge pickup, depending on when you arrive, how long the line is, available staff, etc.\r\n\r\n### Cash Purchase\r\n\r\nBadges will be available for purchase on-site at DEF CON. All badge sales are **cash only**. No checks, money orders, credit cards, etc., will be accepted. In order to keep the registration line moving as quickly as possible, please have **exact change** ready as you near the front of the line.\r\n\r\nThere are no refunds given for cash sales. If you have any doubt about your desire to buy a badge, please refrain from doing so.\r\n\r\nWe are unable to provide printed receipts at the time of the sale. A generic receipt for the cash sale of a badge will be made available on media.defcon.org after the conference. You are welcome to print your own copy of the receipt on plain paper.\r\n\r\n### Via BlackHat \r\n\r\nIf you attend BlackHat, it is possible to purchase a DEF CON badge with your BlackHat registration. If you did so, please get your DEF CON badge from BlackHat before they close. \r\n\r\nBlackHat should send you an email with instructions for how to obtain your DEF CON badge. In case you missed it, you can go to the second floor, at the concierge desk, halfway down Black Hat Blvd.\r\n\r\n# Misc\r\n\r\nWant to buy multiple badges? No problem! We're happy to sell you however many badges you want to pay for.\r\n\r\nIf you lose your badge, there is unfortunately no way for us to replace it. You'll have to buy a replacement at full price. Please don't lose your badge. :( \r\n\r\nIf you are being accompanied by a full-time caretaker (such as someone who will push your wheelchair, and will accompany you at all times), please ask to speak to a Registration Goon.

Please be patient. All of the times listed here are **approximate**. \r\n\r\n# Basics\r\n\r\n### Who needs a badge?\r\n\r\nA badge is required for each human age 8 and older.\r\n\r\n### Human?\r\n\r\nYou are a human if you do not know otherwise. People that are not humans include goons, official speaker, village/community/contest/creator staff, press, black badge holders, or similar. If you are not a human, you need to register separately. If you don't know how, see an NFO goon (NFO Node, formerly known as an infobooth, is where you can get help). The remainder of this message applies only to humans.\r\n\r\n### Lines? Linecon?\r\n\r\nLinecon is your optional opportunity to stand (or sit) in line for human registration to open. Doors will open for linecon on Wednesday at approximately 17:00. When human registration opens on Thursday at approximately 08:00, they start working the linecon queue, and the line will start moving quickly. (Please understand that we will begin processing the line on Thursday morning as soon as the cashiers and materials are in place; we will strive for Thursday 08:00, but actual start may be slightly earlier or later.)\r\n\r\nOnline badge purchase (aka pre-registration) has no impact on linecon. You can join the line on Wednesday (if you wish) regardless of whether you purchased a badge online or intend to pay with cash. There is only one linecon for both types of badge sales. \r\n\r\nPlease help us make this a great experience for everyone by **following directions given by goons**. After human registration opens, there may be one line for all of registration, or there may be two lines (one for online sales (pre-registration) and one for cash sales). This may also change over time, based on available staffing and necessary crowd control. We will strive to make it easily understandable in-person as to which line you should join. \r\n\r\n# Ways to buy a badge\r\n\r\n- $480 [online purchase](https://shop.defcon.org/products/def-con-32-las-vegas-convention-center) until August 1, 2024. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.\r\n- $460 cash purchase on-site.\r\n- As part of a BlackHat registration.\r\n\r\n### Online Purchase\r\n\r\nYou will be emailed a QR code to the email address provided when you bought your badge. Please guard that QR code as though it is cash -- it can only be redeemed once, and anyone can redeem it if they have it (including a photo of it). Badges are picked-up on-site -- they will not be mailed or shipped.\r\n\r\nWe can scan the QR code either from your phone's display or from a printed copy. You **must** have the QR code with you in order to obtain your badge. As you approach the front of the line, if you are going to show your QR code on an electronic device, please ensure that your display is set to maximum brightness. \r\n\r\nIf you pre-registered, but ultimately are unable to attend DEF CON and want to cancel your purchase, the **only** way to get a refund is from the original online source. We are unable to provide any refunds on-site at DEF CON. There is a fee to have your badge canceled: $34 until July 15, and $84 on and after July 15.\r\n\r\nOnline purchases are provided a receipt via email when the purchase is made.\r\n\r\nOnline purchase -- often referred to as pre-registration -- does not allow you to skip any line/queue to pick up your badge. Once you arrive on-site, you will need to join the existing line for human registration. There may or may not be a dedicated line for pre-registration badge pickup, depending on when you arrive, how long the line is, available staff, etc.\r\n\r\n### Cash Purchase\r\n\r\nBadges will be available for purchase on-site at DEF CON. All badge sales are **cash only**. No checks, money orders, credit cards, etc., will be accepted. In order to keep the registration line moving as quickly as possible, please have **exact change** ready as you near the front of the line.\r\n\r\nThere are no refunds given for cash sales. If you have any doubt about your desire to buy a badge, please refrain from doing so.\r\n\r\nWe are unable to provide printed receipts at the time of the sale. A generic receipt for the cash sale of a badge will be made available on media.defcon.org after the conference. You are welcome to print your own copy of the receipt on plain paper.\r\n\r\n### Via BlackHat \r\n\r\nIf you attend BlackHat, it is possible to purchase a DEF CON badge with your BlackHat registration. If you did so, please get your DEF CON badge from BlackHat before they close. \r\n\r\nBlackHat should send you an email with instructions for how to obtain your DEF CON badge. In case you missed it, you can go to the second floor, at the concierge desk, halfway down Black Hat Blvd.\r\n\r\n# Misc\r\n\r\nWant to buy multiple badges? No problem! We're happy to sell you however many badges you want to pay for.\r\n\r\nIf you lose your badge, there is unfortunately no way for us to replace it. You'll have to buy a replacement at full price. Please don't lose your badge. :( \r\n\r\nIf you are being accompanied by a full-time caretaker (such as someone who will push your wheelchair, and will accompany you at all times), please ask to speak to a Registration Goon. Your caretaker will receive a paper badge that will permit them to accompany you everywhere you go.\r\n\r\n# Still need help?\r\n\r\nIf you have questions about anything regarding human registration that are not addressed here, please ask to speak to a Registration Goon.\n\n\n","media":[{"hash_sha256":"8a300e1ae98ec2a54a4a5b4a5378f42ca3196613b8cfeec201265c89f74bada7","filetype":"image/webp","hash_md5":"d5dca56d644276270ebb606349e06742","name":"defcon32preregistrationartc.webp","is_logo":"Y","hash_crc32c":"4ef042a8","filesize":249642,"asset_id":815,"sort_order":1,"url":"https://info.defcon.org/blobs/defcon32preregistrationartc.webp"}],"title":"Human Registration Open","type":{"conference_id":133,"conference":"DEFCON32","updated_at":"2024-07-21T19:20+0000","color":"#9e33ca","name":"Misc","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T19:20:45Z","id":46362},"end_tsz":"2024-08-09T03:00:00Z","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1723172400,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Our human registration process this year will be very similar to previous years. Please be patient. All of the times listed here are **approximate**. \r\n\r\n# Basics\r\n\r\n### Who needs a badge?\r\n\r\nA badge is required for each human age 8 and older.\r\n\r\n### Human?\r\n\r\nYou are a human if you do not know otherwise. People that are not humans include goons, official speaker, village/community/contest/creator staff, press, black badge holders, or similar. If you are not a human, you need to register separately. If you don't know how, see an NFO goon (NFO Node, formerly known as an infobooth, is where you can get help). The remainder of this message applies only to humans.\r\n\r\n### Lines? Linecon?\r\n\r\nLinecon is your optional opportunity to stand (or sit) in line for human registration to open. Doors will open for linecon on Wednesday at approximately 17:00. When human registration opens on Thursday at approximately 08:00, they start working the linecon queue, and the line will start moving quickly. (Please understand that we will begin processing the line on Thursday morning as soon as the cashiers and materials are in place; we will strive for Thursday 08:00, but actual start may be slightly earlier or later.)\r\n\r\nOnline badge purchase (aka pre-registration) has no impact on linecon. You can join the line on Wednesday (if you wish) regardless of whether you purchased a badge online or intend to pay with cash. There is only one linecon for both types of badge sales. \r\n\r\nPlease help us make this a great experience for everyone by **following directions given by goons**. After human registration opens, there may be one line for all of registration, or there may be two lines (one for online sales (pre-registration) and one for cash sales). This may also change over time, based on available staffing and necessary crowd control. We will strive to make it easily understandable in-person as to which line you should join. \r\n\r\n# Ways to buy a badge\r\n\r\n- $480 [online purchase](https://shop.defcon.org/products/def-con-32-las-vegas-convention-center) until August 1, 2024. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.\r\n- $460 cash purchase on-site.\r\n- As part of a BlackHat registration.\r\n\r\n### Online Purchase\r\n\r\nYou will be emailed a QR code to the email address provided when you bought your badge.

Refer to the conference schedule for \"sticker swaps\". We're also putting up multiple sticker walls this year -- it was a hit last year, and we hope that having a couple of them will be even more awesome this year. \r\n\r\nThe LVCVA (Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, owners of the LVCC) has a zero-tolerance policy with regard to adhering anything at all to their property, including stickers. Please DFIU. If you are caught adhering anything to LVCC property, you will likely be trespassed from the property by Las Vegas Police. Beyond stickers, you may also not use tape, sticky putty, tacks, or even non-stick clings. \r\n\r\n## Admission inspections and searches\r\n\r\nThe LVCC will not be searching or scanning people or bags entering the facility.\r\n\r\n## Money\r\n\r\nAs always, human badges (that were not pre-purchased) are exclusively sold using **cash (US currency)**. Merch is the same. No credit cards, debit cards, mobile payments, cryptocurrency, or any means other than USD cash will be accepted at either human registration or DEF CON Merch. We recommend bringing cash with you: there are only two ATMs inside the LVCC.\r\n\r\nFood and beverage operations inside the LVCC, including the food court and bars, only accept cards and mobile payments. **You cannot use cash to purchase food or beverage inside the LVCC.**\r\n\r\nVendors are permitted to conduct transactions via whatever means they choose. We do not have a list of which vendors are accepting cash vs card.\r\n\r\n## Water\r\n\r\nThe LVCC has many modern water-bottle filling stations, so free water will be readily available for those who bring their own reusable water bottles.\r\n\r\n## DCTV\r\n\r\nDCTV will exclusively be streaming online this year, and will not be available on any hotel TV channels.\r\n\r\n## Outside food and beverage\r\n\r\nLVCC prohibits attendees from bringing outside food and beverage into the convention center, except in cases of medical or dietary necessity.\r\n\r\n## Photography policy\r\n\r\nPublic photography is allowed*. It’s okay to take photos of your friends if they’re cool with it. We’ve setup several “selfie spots” that are amazing art pieces created specifically for the yearly theme where you can take cool photos.\r\n\r\nWe want you to take consenting photos of each other and we want others to see the wide range of attendees we have at DEF CON having a good time. What we don’t want to see are group shots taken without consent/warning, images taken by the press, video of people standing in lines, etc.\r\n\r\n**Official Press & DEF CON Policy Village rules may differ, please refer to them.** At DEF CON you may see our official photography goons capturing the uniqueness that is to be expected at DEF CON; they adhere to our photo policy.\r\n\r\nGroups & individuals participating in public on stage (events, contests, or activities) are allowed* to be photographed.\r\n\r\nPhotography in the CTF room is NOT permitted without consent of the individuals to be photographed.\r\n\r\n**Crowd shots are VERY discouraged**, if so desired you must alert the crowd to give them time to opt out. For example: \" Hey, I'm taking a photo, if you don't want to be in it hide your face\" .\r\n\r\nTaking photos of people in hallways, lines, hanging out, at random, is not allowed without consent. Respect the rights of the individual not to be photographed. Deletion of photos can be requested by staff.\r\n\r\nWhen taking pictures of your friends please use “portrait mode” because this will blur the picture background, respecting the privacy of those inadvertently captured.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is permissible to record violations of the DEF CON CoC to share with our safety team (link) to help us investigate and take action.\r\n\r\n* We reserve the right to revoke an individual's permission to photograph, at any time, on a case by case basis. Failure to comply can result in revocation of admission without refund.\n\n\n","media":[],"title":"Important Message","type":{"conference_id":133,"conference":"DEFCON32","updated_at":"2024-07-21T19:20+0000","color":"#9e33ca","name":"Misc","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T19:20:45Z","id":46362},"end_tsz":"2024-08-07T07:00:00Z","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1723014000,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"There are a few things that we would like everyone to be aware of, leading up to DEF CON 32.\r\n\r\n## Sticker Policy\r\n\r\nWe have a beautiful culture of #stickerlife at DEF CON, and we hope that it can continue well into the future.

We're also putting up multiple sticker walls this year -- it was a hit last year, and we hope that having a couple of them will be even more awesome this year. \r\n\r\nThe LVCVA (Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, owners of the LVCC) has a zero-tolerance policy with regard to adhering anything at all to their property, including stickers. Please DFIU. If you are caught adhering anything to LVCC property, you will likely be trespassed from the property by Las Vegas Police. Beyond stickers, you may also not use tape, sticky putty, tacks, or even non-stick clings. \r\n\r\n## Admission inspections and searches\r\n\r\nThe LVCC will not be searching or scanning people or bags entering the facility.\r\n\r\n## Money\r\n\r\nAs always, human badges (that were not pre-purchased) are exclusively sold using **cash (US currency)**. Merch is the same. No credit cards, debit cards, mobile payments, cryptocurrency, or any means other than USD cash will be accepted at either human registration or DEF CON Merch. We recommend bringing cash with you: there are only two ATMs inside the LVCC.\r\n\r\nFood and beverage operations inside the LVCC, including the food court and bars, only accept cards and mobile payments. **You cannot use cash to purchase food or beverage inside the LVCC.**\r\n\r\nVendors are permitted to conduct transactions via whatever means they choose. We do not have a list of which vendors are accepting cash vs card.\r\n\r\n## Water\r\n\r\nThe LVCC has many modern water-bottle filling stations, so free water will be readily available for those who bring their own reusable water bottles.\r\n\r\n## DCTV\r\n\r\nDCTV will exclusively be streaming online this year, and will not be available on any hotel TV channels.\r\n\r\n## Outside food and beverage\r\n\r\nLVCC prohibits attendees from bringing outside food and beverage into the convention center, except in cases of medical or dietary necessity.\r\n\r\n## Photography policy\r\n\r\nPublic photography is allowed*. It’s okay to take photos of your friends if they’re cool with it. We’ve setup several “selfie spots” that are amazing art pieces created specifically for the yearly theme where you can take cool photos.\r\n\r\nWe want you to take consenting photos of each other and we want others to see the wide range of attendees we have at DEF CON having a good time. What we don’t want to see are group shots taken without consent/warning, images taken by the press, video of people standing in lines, etc.\r\n\r\n**Official Press & DEF CON Policy Village rules may differ, please refer to them.** At DEF CON you may see our official photography goons capturing the uniqueness that is to be expected at DEF CON; they adhere to our photo policy.\r\n\r\nGroups & individuals participating in public on stage (events, contests, or activities) are allowed* to be photographed.\r\n\r\nPhotography in the CTF room is NOT permitted without consent of the individuals to be photographed.\r\n\r\n**Crowd shots are VERY discouraged**, if so desired you must alert the crowd to give them time to opt out. For example: \" Hey, I'm taking a photo, if you don't want to be in it hide your face\" .\r\n\r\nTaking photos of people in hallways, lines, hanging out, at random, is not allowed without consent. Respect the rights of the individual not to be photographed. Deletion of photos can be requested by staff.\r\n\r\nWhen taking pictures of your friends please use “portrait mode” because this will blur the picture background, respecting the privacy of those inadvertently captured.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is permissible to record violations of the DEF CON CoC to share with our safety team (link) to help us investigate and take action.\r\n\r\n* We reserve the right to revoke an individual's permission to photograph, at any time, on a case by case basis. Failure to comply can result in revocation of admission without refund.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1723249717,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-07T07:00:00Z","timeband_id":1176,"updated_tsz":"2024-08-10T00:28:37Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-07T07:00:00.000-0000","id":56569,"tag_ids":[46362],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723014000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"Other / See Description","hotel":"","short_name":"Other / See Description","id":46315},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-07T07:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-08-10T00:28:00.000-0000"}]
