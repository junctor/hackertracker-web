In 2023, BlackLotus emerged, downgrading the boot manager to bypass Secure Boot. Microsoft addressed the threat, but was Secure Boot the only component vulnerable to downgrades?\r\n\r\nBy examining Windows Updates, we found a flaw enabling us to take full control over it and craft downgrading updates, bypassing all verification steps.\r\n\r\nWe then managed to downgrade DLLs, drivers, and even the kernel. Afterwards, the OS reported it’s fully updated, unable to install future updates, with recovery tools unable to detect issues.\r\n\r\nWe aimed higher and found that the virtualization stack is at risk too.

In 2023, BlackLotus emerged, downgrading the boot manager to bypass Secure Boot. Microsoft addressed the threat, but was Secure Boot the only component vulnerable to downgrades?\r\n\r\nBy examining Windows Updates, we found a flaw enabling us to take full control over it and craft downgrading updates, bypassing all verification steps.\r\n\r\nWe then managed to downgrade DLLs, drivers, and even the kernel. Afterwards, the OS reported it’s fully updated, unable to install future updates, with recovery tools unable to detect issues.\r\n\r\nWe aimed higher and found that the virtualization stack is at risk too.

Please be patient. All of the times listed here are **approximate**. \r\n\r\n# Basics\r\n\r\n### Who needs a badge?\r\n\r\nA badge is required for each human age 8 and older.\r\n\r\n### Human?\r\n\r\nYou are a human if you do not know otherwise. People that are not humans include goons, official speaker, village/community/contest/creator staff, press, black badge holders, or similar. If you are not a human, you need to register separately. If you don't know how, see an NFO goon (NFO Node, formerly known as an infobooth, is where you can get help). The remainder of this message applies only to humans.\r\n\r\n### Lines? Linecon?\r\n\r\nLinecon is your optional opportunity to stand (or sit) in line for human registration to open. Doors will open for linecon on Wednesday at approximately 17:00. When human registration opens on Thursday at approximately 08:00, they start working the linecon queue, and the line will start moving quickly. (Please understand that we will begin processing the line on Thursday morning as soon as the cashiers and materials are in place; we will strive for Thursday 08:00, but actual start may be slightly earlier or later.)\r\n\r\nOnline badge purchase (aka pre-registration) has no impact on linecon. You can join the line on Wednesday (if you wish) regardless of whether you purchased a badge online or intend to pay with cash. There is only one linecon for both types of badge sales. \r\n\r\nPlease help us make this a great experience for everyone by **following directions given by goons**. After human registration opens, there may be one line for all of registration, or there may be two lines (one for online sales (pre-registration) and one for cash sales). This may also change over time, based on available staffing and necessary crowd control. We will strive to make it easily understandable in-person as to which line you should join. \r\n\r\n# Ways to buy a badge\r\n\r\n- $480 [online purchase](https://shop.defcon.org/products/def-con-32-las-vegas-convention-center) until August 1, 2024. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.\r\n- $460 cash purchase on-site.\r\n- As part of a BlackHat registration.\r\n\r\n### Online Purchase\r\n\r\nYou will be emailed a QR code to the email address provided when you bought your badge. Please guard that QR code as though it is cash -- it can only be redeemed once, and anyone can redeem it if they have it (including a photo of it). Badges are picked-up on-site -- they will not be mailed or shipped.\r\n\r\nWe can scan the QR code either from your phone's display or from a printed copy. You **must** have the QR code with you in order to obtain your badge. As you approach the front of the line, if you are going to show your QR code on an electronic device, please ensure that your display is set to maximum brightness. \r\n\r\nIf you pre-registered, but ultimately are unable to attend DEF CON and want to cancel your purchase, the **only** way to get a refund is from the original online source. We are unable to provide any refunds on-site at DEF CON. There is a fee to have your badge canceled: $34 until July 15, and $84 on and after July 15.\r\n\r\nOnline purchases are provided a receipt via email when the purchase is made.\r\n\r\nOnline purchase -- often referred to as pre-registration -- does not allow you to skip any line/queue to pick up your badge. Once you arrive on-site, you will need to join the existing line for human registration. There may or may not be a dedicated line for pre-registration badge pickup, depending on when you arrive, how long the line is, available staff, etc.\r\n\r\n### Cash Purchase\r\n\r\nBadges will be available for purchase on-site at DEF CON. All badge sales are **cash only**. No checks, money orders, credit cards, etc., will be accepted. In order to keep the registration line moving as quickly as possible, please have **exact change** ready as you near the front of the line.\r\n\r\nThere are no refunds given for cash sales. If you have any doubt about your desire to buy a badge, please refrain from doing so.\r\n\r\nWe are unable to provide printed receipts at the time of the sale. A generic receipt for the cash sale of a badge will be made available on media.defcon.org after the conference. You are welcome to print your own copy of the receipt on plain paper.\r\n\r\n### Via BlackHat \r\n\r\nIf you attend BlackHat, it is possible to purchase a DEF CON badge with your BlackHat registration.

Please be patient. All of the times listed here are **approximate**. \r\n\r\n# Basics\r\n\r\n### Who needs a badge?\r\n\r\nA badge is required for each human age 8 and older.\r\n\r\n### Human?\r\n\r\nYou are a human if you do not know otherwise. People that are not humans include goons, official speaker, village/community/contest/creator staff, press, black badge holders, or similar. If you are not a human, you need to register separately. If you don't know how, see an NFO goon (NFO Node, formerly known as an infobooth, is where you can get help). The remainder of this message applies only to humans.\r\n\r\n### Lines? Linecon?\r\n\r\nLinecon is your optional opportunity to stand (or sit) in line for human registration to open. Doors will open for linecon on Wednesday at approximately 17:00. When human registration opens on Thursday at approximately 08:00, they start working the linecon queue, and the line will start moving quickly. (Please understand that we will begin processing the line on Thursday morning as soon as the cashiers and materials are in place; we will strive for Thursday 08:00, but actual start may be slightly earlier or later.)\r\n\r\nOnline badge purchase (aka pre-registration) has no impact on linecon. You can join the line on Wednesday (if you wish) regardless of whether you purchased a badge online or intend to pay with cash. There is only one linecon for both types of badge sales. \r\n\r\nPlease help us make this a great experience for everyone by **following directions given by goons**. After human registration opens, there may be one line for all of registration, or there may be two lines (one for online sales (pre-registration) and one for cash sales). This may also change over time, based on available staffing and necessary crowd control. We will strive to make it easily understandable in-person as to which line you should join. \r\n\r\n# Ways to buy a badge\r\n\r\n- $480 [online purchase](https://shop.defcon.org/products/def-con-32-las-vegas-convention-center) until August 1, 2024. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.\r\n- $460 cash purchase on-site.\r\n- As part of a BlackHat registration.\r\n\r\n### Online Purchase\r\n\r\nYou will be emailed a QR code to the email address provided when you bought your badge. Please guard that QR code as though it is cash -- it can only be redeemed once, and anyone can redeem it if they have it (including a photo of it). Badges are picked-up on-site -- they will not be mailed or shipped.\r\n\r\nWe can scan the QR code either from your phone's display or from a printed copy. You **must** have the QR code with you in order to obtain your badge. As you approach the front of the line, if you are going to show your QR code on an electronic device, please ensure that your display is set to maximum brightness. \r\n\r\nIf you pre-registered, but ultimately are unable to attend DEF CON and want to cancel your purchase, the **only** way to get a refund is from the original online source. We are unable to provide any refunds on-site at DEF CON. There is a fee to have your badge canceled: $34 until July 15, and $84 on and after July 15.\r\n\r\nOnline purchases are provided a receipt via email when the purchase is made.\r\n\r\nOnline purchase -- often referred to as pre-registration -- does not allow you to skip any line/queue to pick up your badge. Once you arrive on-site, you will need to join the existing line for human registration. There may or may not be a dedicated line for pre-registration badge pickup, depending on when you arrive, how long the line is, available staff, etc.\r\n\r\n### Cash Purchase\r\n\r\nBadges will be available for purchase on-site at DEF CON. All badge sales are **cash only**. No checks, money orders, credit cards, etc., will be accepted. In order to keep the registration line moving as quickly as possible, please have **exact change** ready as you near the front of the line.\r\n\r\nThere are no refunds given for cash sales. If you have any doubt about your desire to buy a badge, please refrain from doing so.\r\n\r\nWe are unable to provide printed receipts at the time of the sale. A generic receipt for the cash sale of a badge will be made available on media.defcon.org after the conference. You are welcome to print your own copy of the receipt on plain paper.\r\n\r\n### Via BlackHat \r\n\r\nIf you attend BlackHat, it is possible to purchase a DEF CON badge with your BlackHat registration.

Clever people around the world hear it and are pulled, every year, to Las Vegas. They mass by the tens of thousands, streaming through the halls of DEF CON to watch talks given by absolute legends about incredible escapades, to gaze in wonder as true wizards bend bytes to their will in the CTF room, and to dream about one day reaching to those heights themselves.\r\n\r\nSome have the critical combination of grit, perseverance, raw talent, and (let's face it) privilege to push through to those dreams of greatness. But among even the clever and the motivated, it is rare for n00bs to rise to l33tness without support. Some find this support in inspiring classes in college. Others, among friends or mentors. But many don't find it at all, and remain in the hallways, dreaming.\r\n\r\nDo you want to leave the hallways and hack the planet? We are hackers, educators, and learners who are creating DEF CON Academy, a concerted effort to maximize hacker potential by providing open, clear, approachable, and inclusive practical resources for budding hackers to transcend and rule cyberspace. Through extensive DEF CON event presence and year-round hacking resources, we will pro up the noobs of the world and bring the community, at scale, to the next level of skill.\r\n\r\nCome, listen, and learn how we can help!\r\n\r\n1.

Clever people around the world hear it and are pulled, every year, to Las Vegas. They mass by the tens of thousands, streaming through the halls of DEF CON to watch talks given by absolute legends about incredible escapades, to gaze in wonder as true wizards bend bytes to their will in the CTF room, and to dream about one day reaching to those heights themselves.\r\n\r\nSome have the critical combination of grit, perseverance, raw talent, and (let's face it) privilege to push through to those dreams of greatness. But among even the clever and the motivated, it is rare for n00bs to rise to l33tness without support. Some find this support in inspiring classes in college. Others, among friends or mentors. But many don't find it at all, and remain in the hallways, dreaming.\r\n\r\nDo you want to leave the hallways and hack the planet? We are hackers, educators, and learners who are creating DEF CON Academy, a concerted effort to maximize hacker potential by providing open, clear, approachable, and inclusive practical resources for budding hackers to transcend and rule cyberspace. Through extensive DEF CON event presence and year-round hacking resources, we will pro up the noobs of the world and bring the community, at scale, to the next level of skill.\r\n\r\nCome, listen, and learn how we can help!\r\n\r\n1.

In this presentation, we report on our security findings from our reverse-engineering efforts to exploit VSAT satellite modems from the Earth. We will focus on the Newtec MDM2200 from iDirect as an example. First, we explain how we reverse-engineered the software stack running on the modem device to find 0-day vulnerabilities. Then, we show how we reverse-engineered the network stack to devise attacks that can be launched by injecting wireless signals through the antenna dish of a VSAT terminal. Finally, we demonstrate our software-defined radio end-to-end attacks to inject bogus firmware updates and to gain a remote root shell access on the modem. To the best of knowledge, this represents the first successful demonstration of signal injection attacks on VSAT modems using software-defined radios from the Earth, while previous attacks on VSAT systems such as the ViaSat hack in 2022 were based on exploiting the operator’s network through Internet VPN connections.

In this talk we do exactly that, and will take a deep dive into Ecovacs robots! Ecovacs is the current market leader for smart home robots and recently expanded in other areas of home robotics.\n\nYou will be surprised how many worrisome things we found: broken crypto, missing TLS certificate verification, honor-system based ACLs, lots of RCEs, broken factory resets and unauthorized live camera access.\n\nWe will discuss our and other researchers experience with reporting bugs to the company and why one cannot trust third party certification agencies. In regard to trust, we will also address why you need to be careful with the choice of your spouse or flatmates.\n\nCome with us on a journey of having fun hacking interesting devices while exploring bad oversights, real problems and the ignorance of the manufacturer.

Ecovacs is the current market leader for smart home robots and recently expanded in other areas of home robotics.\n\nYou will be surprised how many worrisome things we found: broken crypto, missing TLS certificate verification, honor-system based ACLs, lots of RCEs, broken factory resets and unauthorized live camera access.\n\nWe will discuss our and other researchers experience with reporting bugs to the company and why one cannot trust third party certification agencies. In regard to trust, we will also address why you need to be careful with the choice of your spouse or flatmates.\n\nCome with us on a journey of having fun hacking interesting devices while exploring bad oversights, real problems and the ignorance of the manufacturer. Learn what ways there are to root these devices and to use them in a privacy-preserving way.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720331820,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54624,54441],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54814,54998],"name":"Braelynn","affiliations":[{"organization":"Leviathan Security Group","title":"Security Consultant"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54131,"title":"Security Consultant at Leviathan Security Group"},{"content_ids":[54624,54441,54471],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54814,54844,54998],"name":"Dennis Giese","affiliations":[],"pronouns":"he/him","links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@dgi_DE)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/dgi_DE"},{"description":"","title":"Website","sort_order":0,"url":"https://dontvacuum.me"}],"media":[],"id":54142}],"timeband_id":1148,"links":[],"end":"2024-08-10T23:00:00.000-0000","id":54998,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[46169,46379,46511],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723328100,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Demo 💻","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":2,"person_id":54142},{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":4,"person_id":54131}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":46257,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW4-04-02 (Creator Stage 3)","hotel":"","short_name":"HW4-04-02 (Creator Stage 3)","id":46381},"begin":"2024-08-10T22:15:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-07T05:57:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"The ethical and secure disclosure of vulnerabilities in AI has emerged as a pivotal challenge, compounded by the need to address biases and misinformation that often cloud the true nature of these vulnerabilities.

Calls for book banning are at an all time high. Some states have passed laws that hold librarians legally accountable for offering \"unacceptable\" materials to minors. But before this fire started, another one was already burning.

From a TASVideos member taking on 1980's Dragster cheat Todd Rogers, a passing mention of Billy Mitchell, and the TASBot team investigating Super Mario Maker shenanigans, this talk covers several notable cheating incidents and concludes with a systematic takedown of a troll that chilled the Diablo speedrunning community for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nThis talk includes several investigations I have been a part of in some capacity and will ultimately include additional references in the coming months; I've broken the references out by game, presented in Markdown format like the rest of this document:\r\n### Dragster\r\n- [Submission #5517: Omnigamer's A2600 Dragster in 00:08.49](https://tasvideos.org/5517S)\r\n- [A2600 Dragster by Omnigamer in 00:08.49](https://tasvideos.org/3430M)\r\n- [Submission #5876: MrWint & Omnigamer's A2600 Dragster in 00:08.39](https://tasvideos.org/5876S)\r\n- [A2600 Dragster by MrWint, Omnigamer in 00:08.39](https://tasvideos.org/3662M)\r\n- [Omnigamer's Dragster simulator model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HhaBah7e48lBRA18v8Mgr-fRVZS5DUJb_pnOsBTC34c)\r\n- [Dragster optimal sequence project by esnard](https://github.com/esnard/dragster)\r\n- [Investigation into optimal Dragster play by MrWint](https://github.com/MrWint/dragster/tree/master)\r\n- [TASBot beats Dragster in 5.57 (console verification of Omnigamer's TAS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXMxZbPzRzs)\r\n\r\n### Super Mario Maker\r\n- [Inside TASBot’s semi-secret, probably legal effort to control the Nintendo Switch](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/inside-tasbots-semi-secret-probably-legal-effort-to-control-the-nintendo-switch/)\r\n- [The _Super Mario Maker_ community faces its final boss](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/the-super-mario-maker-community-faces-its-final-boss/)\r\n- [_Super Mario Maker_’s “final boss” was a fraud all along](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/super-mario-makers-final-boss-was-a-fraud-all-along/)\r\n- [How to cheat at _Super Mario Maker_ and get away with it for years](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/how-to-cheat-at-super-mario-maker-and-get-away-with-it-for-years/)\r\n- [Trimming the Herbs TAS attempts](https://youtu.be/ypoNHp7aWGM)\r\n- [Trimming the Herbs has been Beaten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7yvVJbji0U)\r\n\r\n# Diablo\r\n- [Speed Demos Archive Diablo page](https://speeddemosarchive.com/Diablo.html)\r\n- [Groobo's 2009 Diablo speedrun submission video](https://speeddemosarchive.com/demo.pl?Diablo_Sorcerer_312)\r\n- [Speed Demos Archive Diablo run review](https://forum.speeddemosarchive.com/post/diablo__february_8th_2009.html)\r\n- [Guinness World Records Diablo entry](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/110580-fastest-completion-of-an-rpg-videogame)\r\n- [Devilution Diablo decompiliation](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilution)\r\n- [DevilutionX Diablo decompiliation](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/)\r\n- [Diablo MapGen](https://github.com/Matthew-petroff/diablo-mapgen)","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720463160,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54501],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54874],"name":"Allan \"dwangoAC\" Cecil","affiliations":[{"organization":"TASBot Online Community","title":"Founder and Leader"}],"pronouns":"he/him","links":[{"description":"","title":"Discord.gg/TASBot","sort_order":0,"url":"https://Discord.gg/TASBot"},{"description":"","title":"TAS.Bot","sort_order":0,"url":"https://TAS.Bot"},{"description":"","title":"Twitch","sort_order":0,"url":"https://Twitch.tv/dwangoAC"},{"description":"","title":"YouTube","sort_order":0,"url":"https://YouTube.com/dwangoAC"}],"media":[],"id":54063,"title":"Founder and Leader at TASBot Online Community"}],"timeband_id":1148,"links":[],"end":"2024-08-10T22:15:00.000-0000","id":54874,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[46166,46169,46438],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723325400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Demo 💻, Tool 🛠","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54063}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":46254,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW1-11-02 (Track 2)","hotel":"","short_name":"HW1-11-02 (Track 2)","id":46301},"begin":"2024-08-10T21:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-08T18:26:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"With the iPhone 15 & iPhone 15 Pro Apple switched their iPhone to USB-C - and introduced a new proprietary USB-C controller: The ACE3.\r\n\r\nBut the ACE3 does more than just handle USB power delivery: It's a full microcontroller running a full USB stack connected to some of the internal busses of the device, and we even managed to access JTAG on the iPhone 15 through it.

I trained the neural network on a dataset of valid ADS-B signals as well as a generated spoofed set of aircraft signals, to teach Fly Catcher how to detect and flag any suspicious ADS-B signals. It does this by checking for discrepancies in the signal's characteristics, such as its location, velocity, and identification.\n\nThe result outputted by the neural network is then displayed onto a radar screen allowing users to detect spoofed aircraft near them. To test the device, I brought it with me for an hour-long flight to scan for a wide variety of aircraft enroute.

During this period, the question of \"How much longer will we be able to do this?\" has been asked countless times, and with good reason. Memory safety and corruption issues with low-level languages have been an enormous challenge for OS and application developers. There are certainly efforts to move to \"safer\" languages such as Rust, but those languages need to mature a bit longer before they're able to stand up to the capabilities of a language like C++. \r\n\r\nThanks to exploit mitigations and memory protections, a large number of these vulnerabilities are not exploitable.

During this period, the question of \"How much longer will we be able to do this?\" has been asked countless times, and with good reason. Memory safety and corruption issues with low-level languages have been an enormous challenge for OS and application developers. There are certainly efforts to move to \"safer\" languages such as Rust, but those languages need to mature a bit longer before they're able to stand up to the capabilities of a language like C++. \r\n\r\nThanks to exploit mitigations and memory protections, a large number of these vulnerabilities are not exploitable. There are the mature mitigations, such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), and then newer ones such as Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET) and Virtualization Based Security (VBS).

Along with this was info on the scammers themselves like login IPs, usernames, and some cracked passwords they use.\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover the technical details of how I reverse engineered this kit, found these vulnerabilities, and collected the victim and admin data for each of these sites.\r\n\r\nMy Blog:\r\n\r\n[link](https://blog.smithsecurity.biz/systematic-destruction-hacking-the-scammers-pt.-2)\r\n[link](https://blog.smithsecurity.biz/hacking-the-scammers)","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720463040,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54482],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54855],"name":"S1nn3r","affiliations":[],"pronouns":"he/him","links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@S1n1st3rSecuri1)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/S1n1st3rSecuri1"},{"description":"","title":"blog.smithsecurity.biz/","sort_order":0,"url":"https://blog.smithsecurity.biz/"}],"media":[],"id":54096}],"timeband_id":1148,"links":[],"end":"2024-08-10T18:15:00.000-0000","id":54855,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[46166],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723311000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54096}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":46254,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW1-11-03 (Track 3)","hotel":"","short_name":"HW1-11-03 (Track 3)","id":46302},"begin":"2024-08-10T17:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-08T18:24:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"In recent years, web cache attacks have become a popular way to steal sensitive data, deface websites, and deliver exploits.

It can take significant time with the human eye to analyze each image or video. Furthermore, you may miss important artifacts in the foreground or background. Computer vision can churn through the plethora of data to pull out the relevant evidence at lightning speed. For the last 5 years we’ve been exploring the use of Azure and AWS for computer vision to rapidly process large sets of image and video data acquisitions for forensic evidence.Through the use of AI we have analyzed thousands of images and videos to perform object detection, facial recognition, OCR, voice to text analysis, and more. In this session we’ll explore the use of cloud platforms to exponentially increase your analysis of uncovering key artifacts to your case using demos and real world examples. We then apply chronolocation analysis to allow an investigator to paint a true-life narrative, for example an individual with a weapon at a location at a particular time. We’ll provide live demos of common scenarios to reveal benefits to processing your data collections in a rapid, efficient, comprehensive, and accurate manner. We’ll then wrap-up the presentation with additional AI computer vision recommendations and resources.\n\n\n","title":"Using AI Computer Vision in Your OSINT Data Analysis","type":{"conference_id":133,"conference":"DEFCON32","updated_at":"2024-07-20T23:55+0000","color":"#069622","name":"Creator Talk/Panel","id":46511},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1723312800,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"OSINT is a great mechanism for the collection of data, but what do you do with all of it once it’s collected?

(Please understand that we will begin processing the line on Thursday morning as soon as the cashiers and materials are in place; we will strive for Thursday 08:00, but actual start may be slightly earlier or later.)\r\n\r\nOnline badge purchase (aka pre-registration) has no impact on linecon. You can join the line on Wednesday (if you wish) regardless of whether you purchased a badge online or intend to pay with cash. There is only one linecon for both types of badge sales. \r\n\r\nPlease help us make this a great experience for everyone by **following directions given by goons**. After human registration opens, there may be one line for all of registration, or there may be two lines (one for online sales (pre-registration) and one for cash sales). This may also change over time, based on available staffing and necessary crowd control. We will strive to make it easily understandable in-person as to which line you should join. \r\n\r\n# Ways to buy a badge\r\n\r\n- $480 [online purchase](https://shop.defcon.org/products/def-con-32-las-vegas-convention-center) until August 1, 2024. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.\r\n- $460 cash purchase on-site.\r\n- As part of a BlackHat registration.\r\n\r\n### Online Purchase\r\n\r\nYou will be emailed a QR code to the email address provided when you bought your badge. Please guard that QR code as though it is cash -- it can only be redeemed once, and anyone can redeem it if they have it (including a photo of it). Badges are picked-up on-site -- they will not be mailed or shipped.\r\n\r\nWe can scan the QR code either from your phone's display or from a printed copy. You **must** have the QR code with you in order to obtain your badge. As you approach the front of the line, if you are going to show your QR code on an electronic device, please ensure that your display is set to maximum brightness. \r\n\r\nIf you pre-registered, but ultimately are unable to attend DEF CON and want to cancel your purchase, the **only** way to get a refund is from the original online source. We are unable to provide any refunds on-site at DEF CON. There is a fee to have your badge canceled: $34 until July 15, and $84 on and after July 15.\r\n\r\nOnline purchases are provided a receipt via email when the purchase is made.\r\n\r\nOnline purchase -- often referred to as pre-registration -- does not allow you to skip any line/queue to pick up your badge. Once you arrive on-site, you will need to join the existing line for human registration. There may or may not be a dedicated line for pre-registration badge pickup, depending on when you arrive, how long the line is, available staff, etc.\r\n\r\n### Cash Purchase\r\n\r\nBadges will be available for purchase on-site at DEF CON. All badge sales are **cash only**. No checks, money orders, credit cards, etc., will be accepted. In order to keep the registration line moving as quickly as possible, please have **exact change** ready as you near the front of the line.\r\n\r\nThere are no refunds given for cash sales. If you have any doubt about your desire to buy a badge, please refrain from doing so.\r\n\r\nWe are unable to provide printed receipts at the time of the sale. A generic receipt for the cash sale of a badge will be made available on media.defcon.org after the conference. You are welcome to print your own copy of the receipt on plain paper.\r\n\r\n### Via BlackHat \r\n\r\nIf you attend BlackHat, it is possible to purchase a DEF CON badge with your BlackHat registration. If you did so, please get your DEF CON badge from BlackHat before they close. \r\n\r\n# Misc\r\n\r\nWant to buy multiple badges? No problem! We're happy to sell you however many badges you want to pay for.\r\n\r\nIf you lose your badge, there is unfortunately no way for us to replace it. You'll have to buy a replacement at full price. Please don't lose your badge. :( \r\n\r\nIf you are being accompanied by a full-time caretaker (such as someone who will push your wheelchair, and will accompany you at all times), please ask to speak to a Registration Goon. Your caretaker will receive a paper badge that will permit them to accompany you everywhere you go.\r\n\r\n# Still need help?\r\n\r\nIf you have questions about anything regarding human registration that are not addressed here, please ask to speak to a Registration Goon.\n\n\n","title":"Human Registration Open","type":{"conference_id":133,"conference":"DEFCON32","updated_at":"2024-07-20T23:55+0000","color":"#9e33ca","name":"Misc","id":46362},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1723341600,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Our human registration process this year will be very similar to previous years.

Due to the ever-growing role of wireless protocols such as Bluetooth and a known lack of patches alongside the difficulty of patch installation, this poses a new attack surface and a genuine threat to the users. At the same time, the tools and methodologies required for testing are scattered across the Internet, absent and need a rigorous setup.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we share a comprehensive framework BlueToolkit to test and replay Bluetooth Classic vulnerabilities. We provide practical information and tips. Additionally, we release new exploits and a privilege escalation attack vector.\r\n\r\nWe show how we used the toolkit to find 64 new vulnerabilities in 22 modern cars and the Garmin Flight Stream flight management system used in several aircraft types.\r\nOur work equips Bluetooth hackers with necessary information on novel implementation-specific vulnerabilities that could be used to steal information from target cars, establish MitM position or escalate privileges to hijack victims’ accounts stealthily.\r\n\r\nWe believe our research will be beneficial in finding new vulnerabilities and making Bluetooth research more accessible and reproducible.\r\n\r\n0.

Due to the ever-growing role of wireless protocols such as Bluetooth and a known lack of patches alongside the difficulty of patch installation, this poses a new attack surface and a genuine threat to the users. At the same time, the tools and methodologies required for testing are scattered across the Internet, absent and need a rigorous setup.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we share a comprehensive framework BlueToolkit to test and replay Bluetooth Classic vulnerabilities. We provide practical information and tips. Additionally, we release new exploits and a privilege escalation attack vector.\r\n\r\nWe show how we used the toolkit to find 64 new vulnerabilities in 22 modern cars and the Garmin Flight Stream flight management system used in several aircraft types.\r\nOur work equips Bluetooth hackers with necessary information on novel implementation-specific vulnerabilities that could be used to steal information from target cars, establish MitM position or escalate privileges to hijack victims’ accounts stealthily.\r\n\r\nWe believe our research will be beneficial in finding new vulnerabilities and making Bluetooth research more accessible and reproducible.\r\n\r\n0.

We will demonstrate how luck is no longer an element to consider when your work is SE from Monday  to Friday and you have to perform this type of service every month.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720395900,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54585],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54960],"name":"Daniel Isler","affiliations":[{"organization":"Dreamlab Technologies Chile","title":"Team Leader, Fr1endly RATs"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54367,"title":"Team Leader, Fr1endly RATs at Dreamlab Technologies Chile"}],"timeband_id":1147,"links":[],"end":"2024-08-10T00:00:00.000-0000","id":54960,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[46367,46511],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723246200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54367}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":46257,"name":"LVCC - L1 - HW4-04-02 (Creator Stage 3)","hotel":"","short_name":"HW4-04-02 (Creator Stage 3)","id":46381},"begin":"2024-08-09T23:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-07T23:45:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Introduction to industrial control systems: \r\n- What is ICS \r\n- Purdue model\r\n- How ICS is architected\r\n- Attacker view of ICS architecture\r\n- How to build your own ICS lab \r\n- Equipment \r\n- How to learn / conduct vulnerability research\r\n\n\n\n","title":"ICS 101","type":{"conference_id":133,"conference":"DEFCON32","updated_at":"2024-07-20T23:55+0000","color":"#069622","name":"Creator Talk/Panel","id":46511},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1723248000,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Introduction to industrial control systems: \r\n- What is ICS \r\n- Purdue model\r\n- How ICS is architected\r\n- Attacker view of ICS architecture\r\n- How to build your own ICS lab \r\n- Equipment \r\n- How to learn / conduct vulnerability research","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720984380,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54584],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54959],"name":"Bryson Bort ","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54266},{"content_ids":[54584,54574],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54949,54959],"name":"Tom VanNorman","affiliations":[{"organization":"ICS Village","title":""}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54316,"title":"ICS Village"}],"timeband_id":1147,"links":[],"end":"2024-08-10T00:00:00.000-0000","id":54959,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[46382,46511],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723246200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54266},{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54316}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":46252,"name":"LVCC - L2 - W222 (Creator Stage 4)","hotel":"","short_name":"W222 (Creator Stage 4)","id":46313},"begin":"2024-08-09T23:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-14T19:13:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Pawning countries at top level domain by just buying one specific domain name ‘wpad.tld’, come hear about this more the 25+ years old issue and the research from running eight different wpad.tld domains for more than one year that turn into more the 1+ billion DNS request and more then 600+GB of Apache log data with leaked information from the clients.\r\n\r\nThis is the story about how easy it is to just buying one domain and then many hundreds of thousands of Internet clients will get auto pwned without knowing it and start sending traffic to this man-in-the-middle setup there is bypassing encryption and can change content with the ability to get the clients to download harmful content and execute it.\r\n\r\nThe talk will explain the technical behind this issue and showcase why and how clients will be trick into this Man-in-the-middle trap.\r\n\r\n1.

Further, school districts and independent schools must take steps to protect themselves from the threat of ransomware, data breaches, and other forms of criminal activity.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720331820,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54582],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54957],"name":"Avi McGrady","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54315}],"timeband_id":1147,"links":[],"end":"2024-08-09T23:30:00.000-0000","id":54957,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[46388,46511],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723244400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54315}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":46252,"name":"LVCC - L2 - W222 (Creator Stage 4)","hotel":"","short_name":"W222 (Creator Stage 4)","id":46313},"begin":"2024-08-09T23:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-07T05:57:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Contract (ADS-C) is a satellite-based aviation datalink application used to monitor aircraft in remote regions.

Second, we build two software-defined radio receivers in order to analyze over 120’000 real-world ADS-C messages. We further illustrate ADS-C’s lack of authentication by implementing an ADS-C transmitter, which is capable of generating and sending arbitrary ADS-C messages. Finally, we use the channel control offered through a software-defined ADS-C receiver and transmitter as a basis for an in-depth analysis of the protocol weaknesses of the ADS-C system.

To enhance user convenience, many dash cams are now equipped with network connectivity. This growth in the dash cam market has heightened the importance of vehicle and personal data security. However, network-connected dash cams pose potential security risks to their availability and key functionalities.  In this presentation, we will comprehensively analyze dash cams from various countries, including South Korea, the USA, Germany, and China, as well as built-in dash cams. During our analysis, we discovered numerous zero-day vulnerabilities (such as OS Command Injection, Logical Bugs, and insufficient authentication) that pose significant security threats. Vulnerabilities were primarily found during the dash cam boot process, configuration changes, and communications via custom protocols. We will detail the dash cam analysis process in the following sequence:\r\n\r\n[Analysis Process]\r\n- Acquiring firmware through official websites or apps\r\n- Extracting the file system to analyze the initial boot logic\r\n- Analyzing the boot logic to identify vulnerabilities or debugging ports to gain shell access\r\n- Utilizing the obtained shell for remote debugging of the main system\r\n\r\nInterestingly, our analysis of 10 different dash cams revealed that 4 devices used the same OEM board from a common manufacturer. These 4 devices shared similar vulnerabilities, and exploiting a vulnerability found in one device allowed us to successfully exploit all of them.  Our research uncovered common security vulnerabilities across multiple dash cams, and we will discuss measures to prevent these vulnerabilities. We will particularly focus on analyzing the custom protocols used by dash cams and the security risks associated with them.  This presentation aims to raise awareness of potential security threats in dash cams and encourage manufacturers to produce more secure products. We hope to drive industry standards and best practices to ensure the safety and security of these increasingly critical devices.

Instead, adversaries might shift their focus away from the Space Segment and opt for a more practical approach, such as accessing and exploiting the Ground Segment vulnerabilities and flaws in order to gain control over spacecraft. Every space mission comprises custom-made hardware and software components, which interact with each other utilizing dedicated protocols and standards designed and developed for this sole purpose.

This presentation will demonstrate how virtually anyone with a pulse can now use AI to craft sophisticated phishing sites and conduct vishing operations with unprecedented subtlety and effectiveness. These next-generation techniques are transforming the landscape of social engineering. \r\n\r\nYou will learn how to replicate these advanced techniques to elevate your own social-engineering game. You will learn how criminals can manipulate AI tools to simulate real-world attacks and gain a deeper insight into their tactics. You’ll learn how to use A.I. to enhance how you attack now & ways for it to supplement skills you don’t currently have.    \r\n\r\nYou will learn how to leverage these techniques to transform an organization’s, traditional, “security awareness” mentality into a “situational awareness” mindset. Using real-world examples, we demonstrate turning potential threats into teachable moments. \r\n\r\nThis session is essential for anyone looking to harness the power of AI in hacking and Red Teaming. We offer practical skills to engage employees and enhance your approach to social engineering both offensively and defensively.

Using tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot, attackers can make phishing and vishing attacks nearly impossible to distinguish from legitimate Interactions. This presentation will demonstrate how virtually anyone with a pulse can now use AI to craft sophisticated phishing sites and conduct vishing operations with unprecedented subtlety and effectiveness. These next-generation techniques are transforming the landscape of social engineering. \r\n\r\nYou will learn how to replicate these advanced techniques to elevate your own social-engineering game. You will learn how criminals can manipulate AI tools to simulate real-world attacks and gain a deeper insight into their tactics. You’ll learn how to use A.I. to enhance how you attack now & ways for it to supplement skills you don’t currently have.    \r\n\r\nYou will learn how to leverage these techniques to transform an organization’s, traditional, “security awareness” mentality into a “situational awareness” mindset. Using real-world examples, we demonstrate turning potential threats into teachable moments. \r\n\r\nThis session is essential for anyone looking to harness the power of AI in hacking and Red Teaming. We offer practical skills to engage employees and enhance your approach to social engineering both offensively and defensively. And yes, we do this with a certain theme in mind as I ENGAGE the audience as we boldly go where no Hackers have gone before!\r\n\r\n1.

Some services utilize others as resources as part of their logic/operation. Interestingly enough, it turns out that this could lead to catastrophic results if done unsafely.This talk will present six critical vulnerabilities that we found in AWS, along with the stories and methodologies behind them. These vulnerabilities could allow external attackers to breach almost any AWS account. The vulnerabilities range from remote code execution, which could lead to full account takeover, to information disclosure, potentially exposing sensitive data, or causing denial of service. The session will share our story of discovery, how we were able to identify commonalities among them, and how we developed a method to uncover more vulnerabilities and enhance the impact by using common techniques leading to privilege escalation. We will then detail our approach for mapping service external resources and release our Open-Source tool to research service internal API calls.

Some services utilize others as resources as part of their logic/operation. Interestingly enough, it turns out that this could lead to catastrophic results if done unsafely.This talk will present six critical vulnerabilities that we found in AWS, along with the stories and methodologies behind them. These vulnerabilities could allow external attackers to breach almost any AWS account. The vulnerabilities range from remote code execution, which could lead to full account takeover, to information disclosure, potentially exposing sensitive data, or causing denial of service. The session will share our story of discovery, how we were able to identify commonalities among them, and how we developed a method to uncover more vulnerabilities and enhance the impact by using common techniques leading to privilege escalation. We will then detail our approach for mapping service external resources and release our Open-Source tool to research service internal API calls. We will also present a method to check if accounts have been vulnerable to this vector in the past.We will conclude our talk with the lessons learned during this research and our future line of research.

With Tommyknocker, controls can be tested multiple times per day, ensuring that alerts are raised as soon as possible when a control ceases to function correctly, or is compromised by a threat actor.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1718922180,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54166],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54535],"name":"Jeremy Banker","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":53743}],"timeband_id":1147,"end":"2024-08-09T22:45:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"DEF CON Forums","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/249615"},{"label":"Project","type":"link","url":"https://github.com/loredous/tommyknocker"}],"id":54535,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[46169,46441,46445,46453,46455,46464,46465],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723237200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Demo 💻","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":2,"person_id":53743}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":46253,"name":"LVCC - L3 - W303","hotel":"","short_name":"W303","id":46326},"begin":"2024-08-09T21:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-06-20T22:23:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Malware traffic is commonly identified using signatures based off its code, strings, and associated network infrastructure.

However, by executing these tests across a distributed network of hundreds of devices, these challenges can be overcome. Organizing such a large-scale attack efficiently is complex, as the number of nodes increases, so does the difficulty in orchestration and management. distribRuted provides the necessary infrastructure and orchestration for distributed attacks.

However, by executing these tests across a distributed network of hundreds of devices, these challenges can be overcome. Organizing such a large-scale attack efficiently is complex, as the number of nodes increases, so does the difficulty in orchestration and management. distribRuted provides the necessary infrastructure and orchestration for distributed attacks.

We will discuss the details of ALPC and RPC in the marshal/unmarshal process that has not been disclosed before. We'll also talk about the kernel security mechanism in ALPC syscalls. Then we will analyze some historical bugs in ALPC and RPC, and disclose the details of the vulnerability we found, discussing how we bypassed the security mechanism through a small security flaw in security mechanisms. Later we'll discuss the exploitation, you will learn about the multiple ways. Finally, We'll make conclusions and share our opinions on this attack surface, including some tips and opinions on how to find these kinds of bugs.\n\n1.

You should have some entry-level knowledge on Windows systems, C programing and reverse engineering to fully enjoy the workshop.\nIt is expected from the student to bring a laptop with either a Windows 10 or Windows 10 VM, a C compiler (Mingw or MSVC), a decompiler (IDA Free or Ghidra), the WinDBG debugger and the Sysinternals suite. I will personally use the following toolchain : WIN10, MSVC, IDA, WinDBG Preview.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1719533880,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54220],"conference_id":133,"event_ids":[54593],"name":"Yoann Dequeker","affiliations":[{"organization":"Wavestone","title":"Red Team Operator"}],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@OtterHacker)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/OtterHacker"}],"media":[],"id":53876,"title":"Red Team Operator at Wavestone"}],"timeband_id":1147,"end":"2024-08-09T20:00:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Eventbrite Registration - 2024-07-07 12:00 US/Pacific","type":"link","url":"https://Dequeker_DC32.eventbrite.com"}],"id":54593,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[46429,46489],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723219200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46167,"sort_order":1,"person_id":53876}],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":46303,"name":"Springhill Suites - Dean Martin","hotel":"","short_name":"Dean Martin","id":46327},"begin":"2024-08-09T16:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-06-28T00:18:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"In the unpredictable world of healthcare, the ability to respond effectively to emergencies and technology failures is paramount to ensuring patient safety and continuity of care.

People that are not humans include goons, official speaker, village/community/contest/creator staff, press, black badge holders, or similar. If you are not a human, you need to register separately. If you don't know how, see an NFO goon (NFO Node, formerly known as an infobooth, is where you can get help). The remainder of this message applies only to humans.\r\n\r\n### Lines? Linecon?\r\n\r\nLinecon is your optional opportunity to stand (or sit) in line for human registration to open. Doors will open for linecon on Wednesday at approximately 17:00. When human registration opens on Thursday at approximately 08:00, they start working the linecon queue, and the line will start moving quickly.

Please guard that QR code as though it is cash -- it can only be redeemed once, and anyone can redeem it if they have it (including a photo of it). Badges are picked-up on-site -- they will not be mailed or shipped.\r\n\r\nWe can scan the QR code either from your phone's display or from a printed copy.

There may or may not be a dedicated line for pre-registration badge pickup, depending on when you arrive, how long the line is, available staff, etc.\r\n\r\n### Cash Purchase\r\n\r\nBadges will be available for purchase on-site at DEF CON. All badge sales are **cash only**. No checks, money orders, credit cards, etc., will be accepted. In order to keep the registration line moving as quickly as possible, please have **exact change** ready as you near the front of the line.\r\n\r\nThere are no refunds given for cash sales.

People that are not humans include goons, official speaker, village/community/contest/creator staff, press, black badge holders, or similar. If you are not a human, you need to register separately. If you don't know how, see an NFO goon (NFO Node, formerly known as an infobooth, is where you can get help). The remainder of this message applies only to humans.\r\n\r\n### Lines? Linecon?\r\n\r\nLinecon is your optional opportunity to stand (or sit) in line for human registration to open. Doors will open for linecon on Wednesday at approximately 17:00. When human registration opens on Thursday at approximately 08:00, they start working the linecon queue, and the line will start moving quickly. (Please understand that we will begin processing the line on Thursday morning as soon as the cashiers and materials are in place; we will strive for Thursday 08:00, but actual start may be slightly earlier or later.)\r\n\r\nOnline badge purchase (aka pre-registration) has no impact on linecon. You can join the line on Wednesday (if you wish) regardless of whether you purchased a badge online or intend to pay with cash. There is only one linecon for both types of badge sales. \r\n\r\nPlease help us make this a great experience for everyone by **following directions given by goons**. After human registration opens, there may be one line for all of registration, or there may be two lines (one for online sales (pre-registration) and one for cash sales). This may also change over time, based on available staffing and necessary crowd control. We will strive to make it easily understandable in-person as to which line you should join. \r\n\r\n# Ways to buy a badge\r\n\r\n- $480 [online purchase](https://shop.defcon.org/products/def-con-32-las-vegas-convention-center) until August 1, 2024. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.\r\n- $460 cash purchase on-site.\r\n- As part of a BlackHat registration.\r\n\r\n### Online Purchase\r\n\r\nYou will be emailed a QR code to the email address provided when you bought your badge. Please guard that QR code as though it is cash -- it can only be redeemed once, and anyone can redeem it if they have it (including a photo of it). Badges are picked-up on-site -- they will not be mailed or shipped.\r\n\r\nWe can scan the QR code either from your phone's display or from a printed copy. You **must** have the QR code with you in order to obtain your badge. As you approach the front of the line, if you are going to show your QR code on an electronic device, please ensure that your display is set to maximum brightness. \r\n\r\nIf you pre-registered, but ultimately are unable to attend DEF CON and want to cancel your purchase, the **only** way to get a refund is from the original online source. We are unable to provide any refunds on-site at DEF CON. There is a fee to have your badge canceled: $34 until July 15, and $84 on and after July 15.\r\n\r\nOnline purchases are provided a receipt via email when the purchase is made.\r\n\r\nOnline purchase -- often referred to as pre-registration -- does not allow you to skip any line/queue to pick up your badge. Once you arrive on-site, you will need to join the existing line for human registration. There may or may not be a dedicated line for pre-registration badge pickup, depending on when you arrive, how long the line is, available staff, etc.\r\n\r\n### Cash Purchase\r\n\r\nBadges will be available for purchase on-site at DEF CON. All badge sales are **cash only**. No checks, money orders, credit cards, etc., will be accepted. In order to keep the registration line moving as quickly as possible, please have **exact change** ready as you near the front of the line.\r\n\r\nThere are no refunds given for cash sales. If you have any doubt about your desire to buy a badge, please refrain from doing so.\r\n\r\nWe are unable to provide printed receipts at the time of the sale. A generic receipt for the cash sale of a badge will be made available on media.defcon.org after the conference. You are welcome to print your own copy of the receipt on plain paper.\r\n\r\n### Via BlackHat \r\n\r\nIf you attend BlackHat, it is possible to purchase a DEF CON badge with your BlackHat registration. If you did so, please get your DEF CON badge from BlackHat before they close. \r\n\r\n# Misc\r\n\r\nWant to buy multiple badges? No problem! We're happy to sell you however many badges you want to pay for.\r\n\r\nIf you lose your badge, there is unfortunately no way for us to replace it. You'll have to buy a replacement at full price. Please don't lose your badge. :( \r\n\r\nIf you are being accompanied by a full-time caretaker (such as someone who will push your wheelchair, and will accompany you at all times), please ask to speak to a Registration Goon. Your caretaker will receive a paper badge that will permit them to accompany you everywhere you go.\r\n\r\n# Still need help?\r\n\r\nIf you have questions about anything regarding human registration that are not addressed here, please ask to speak to a Registration Goon.\n\n\n","title":"Human Registration Open","type":{"conference_id":133,"conference":"DEFCON32","updated_at":"2024-07-20T23:55+0000","color":"#9e33ca","name":"Misc","id":46362},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1723176000,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Our human registration process this year will be very similar to previous years.

Badges are picked-up on-site -- they will not be mailed or shipped.\r\n\r\nWe can scan the QR code either from your phone's display or from a printed copy. You **must** have the QR code with you in order to obtain your badge. As you approach the front of the line, if you are going to show your QR code on an electronic device, please ensure that your display is set to maximum brightness. \r\n\r\nIf you pre-registered, but ultimately are unable to attend DEF CON and want to cancel your purchase, the **only** way to get a refund is from the original online source. We are unable to provide any refunds on-site at DEF CON. There is a fee to have your badge canceled: $34 until July 15, and $84 on and after July 15.\r\n\r\nOnline purchases are provided a receipt via email when the purchase is made.\r\n\r\nOnline purchase -- often referred to as pre-registration -- does not allow you to skip any line/queue to pick up your badge. Once you arrive on-site, you will need to join the existing line for human registration. There may or may not be a dedicated line for pre-registration badge pickup, depending on when you arrive, how long the line is, available staff, etc.\r\n\r\n### Cash Purchase\r\n\r\nBadges will be available for purchase on-site at DEF CON. All badge sales are **cash only**. No checks, money orders, credit cards, etc., will be accepted. In order to keep the registration line moving as quickly as possible, please have **exact change** ready as you near the front of the line.\r\n\r\nThere are no refunds given for cash sales. If you have any doubt about your desire to buy a badge, please refrain from doing so.\r\n\r\nWe are unable to provide printed receipts at the time of the sale. A generic receipt for the cash sale of a badge will be made available on media.defcon.org after the conference. You are welcome to print your own copy of the receipt on plain paper.\r\n\r\n### Via BlackHat \r\n\r\nIf you attend BlackHat, it is possible to purchase a DEF CON badge with your BlackHat registration. If you did so, please get your DEF CON badge from BlackHat before they close. \r\n\r\n# Misc\r\n\r\nWant to buy multiple badges? No problem! We're happy to sell you however many badges you want to pay for.\r\n\r\nIf you lose your badge, there is unfortunately no way for us to replace it. You'll have to buy a replacement at full price. Please don't lose your badge. :( \r\n\r\nIf you are being accompanied by a full-time caretaker (such as someone who will push your wheelchair, and will accompany you at all times), please ask to speak to a Registration Goon. Your caretaker will receive a paper badge that will permit them to accompany you everywhere you go.\r\n\r\n# Still need help?\r\n\r\nIf you have questions about anything regarding human registration that are not addressed here, please ask to speak to a Registration Goon.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1721354280,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"timeband_id":1146,"links":[],"end":"2024-08-09T04:00:00.000-0000","id":54478,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[46362],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723129200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":133,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"LVCC West Hall","hotel":"","short_name":"LVCC West","id":46180},"begin":"2024-08-08T15:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-19T01:58:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday: 05:00 to 08:00, with random pop up meetings throughout the day in the con space.\r\n\r\nDefcon.run is an evolution of the now long running DEF CON 4x5K running event.
