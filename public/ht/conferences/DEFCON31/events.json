everywhere, whether you like it or not. Our laptops, phones, printers, cars, bank cards and washing machines use cryptography to authenticate, keep things confidential and make sure messages aren’t tampered with. However, very often developers, pentesters, system designers and code auditors are confronted with cryptography without having the gear to properly assess security of a specific use case.\r\n\r\nDuring this training we'll deep-dive into modern cryptography. We'll learn how it works, how it is often times misused and how that leads to exploitable bugs. Moreover, participants will learn how common cryptography screwups can be exploited. To foster skills, participants will write their own exploits and use them on real world systems provided by us.\r\n\r\nThe first day will prepare you for (ab)using cryptography in products and services by going over the basic terminology, explaining modern primitives and showing common misuses of those primitives. You'll learn about tools and techniques to abuse such misuses along the way.

However, very often developers, pentesters, system designers and code auditors are confronted with cryptography without having the gear to properly assess security of a specific use case.\r\n\r\nDuring this training we'll deep-dive into modern cryptography. We'll learn how it works, how it is often times misused and how that leads to exploitable bugs. Moreover, participants will learn how common cryptography screwups can be exploited. To foster skills, participants will write their own exploits and use them on real world systems provided by us.\r\n\r\nThe first day will prepare you for (ab)using cryptography in products and services by going over the basic terminology, explaining modern primitives and showing common misuses of those primitives. You'll learn about tools and techniques to abuse such misuses along the way. On day two, we'll move on to more advanced primitives used in asymmetric cryptography and see how everything we have learned is employed in protocols and standards (such as TLS, JWT and FIDO).","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691978460,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[52418],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52717,52718],"name":"Ruben Gonzalez","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51638},{"content_ids":[52418],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52717,52718],"name":"Tim Schmidt","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":"he/him","media":[],"id":51639}],"timeband_id":1090,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-15T00:00:00.000-0000","id":52717,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45641,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1692025200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45878,"sort_order":2,"person_id":51638},{"tag_id":45878,"sort_order":4,"person_id":51639}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"Caesars Forum","hotel":"","short_name":"Caesars Forum","id":45722},"begin":"2023-08-14T15:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-14T02:01:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Identify vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts written in Solidity\n\n\n","title":"Hackable.sol: Smart Contract Hacking in Solidity","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-07-15T16:40+0000","color":"#767daa","name":"Paid Training","id":45641},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1692057600,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Identify vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts written in Solidity","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691977800,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[52417],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52715,52716],"name":"Davide Cioccia","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51637}],"timeband_id":1090,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-15T00:00:00.000-0000","id":52715,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45641,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1692025200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":51637}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"Caesars Forum","hotel":"","short_name":"Caesars Forum","id":45722},"begin":"2023-08-14T15:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-14T01:50:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to attack and assess Kubernetes clusters environments at different layers.\n\n\n","title":"A Practical Approach to Breaking & Pwning Kubernetes Clusters","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-07-15T16:40+0000","color":"#767daa","name":"Paid Training","id":45641},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1692057600,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to attack and assess Kubernetes clusters environments at different layers.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691977740,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[52416],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52713,52714],"name":"Madhu Akula","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51636}],"timeband_id":1090,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-15T00:00:00.000-0000","id":52713,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45641,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1692025200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":51636}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"Caesars Forum","hotel":"","short_name":"Caesars Forum","id":45722},"begin":"2023-08-14T15:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-14T01:49:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"This class is a beginner's introduction to practical Software Defined Radio (SDR) applications and development with an emphasis on hands-on learning.

As hackers we can only do what we've always done, embrace the machine and use it to do our bidding.\r\n\r\nThere are many valid criticisms of GPT models for writing code like the tendency to hallucinate functions, not being able to reason about architecture, training done on amateur code, limited context due to token length, and more. None of which are particularly important when writing fuzz tests. This presentation will delve into the integration of LLMs into fuzz testing, providing attendees with the insights and tools necessary to transform and automate their security assessment strategies.\r\n\r\nThe presentation will kick off with an introduction to LLMs; how they work, the potential use cases and challenges for hackers, prompt writing tips, and the deficiencies of current models. We will then provide a high level overview explaining the purpose, goals, and obstacles of fuzzing, why this research was undertaken, and why we chose to start with 'memory safe' Python. We will then explore efficient usage of LLMs for coding, and the primary benefits LLMs offer for security work, paving the way for a comprehensive understanding of how LLMs can automate tasks traditionally performed by humans in fuzz testing engagements.\r\n\r\nWe will then introduce FuzzForest, an open source tool that harnesses the power of LLMs to automatically write, fix, and triage fuzz tests on Python code.

As hackers we can only do what we've always done, embrace the machine and use it to do our bidding.\r\n\r\nThere are many valid criticisms of GPT models for writing code like the tendency to hallucinate functions, not being able to reason about architecture, training done on amateur code, limited context due to token length, and more. None of which are particularly important when writing fuzz tests. This presentation will delve into the integration of LLMs into fuzz testing, providing attendees with the insights and tools necessary to transform and automate their security assessment strategies.\r\n\r\nThe presentation will kick off with an introduction to LLMs; how they work, the potential use cases and challenges for hackers, prompt writing tips, and the deficiencies of current models. We will then provide a high level overview explaining the purpose, goals, and obstacles of fuzzing, why this research was undertaken, and why we chose to start with 'memory safe' Python. We will then explore efficient usage of LLMs for coding, and the primary benefits LLMs offer for security work, paving the way for a comprehensive understanding of how LLMs can automate tasks traditionally performed by humans in fuzz testing engagements.\r\n\r\nWe will then introduce FuzzForest, an open source tool that harnesses the power of LLMs to automatically write, fix, and triage fuzz tests on Python code. A thorough discussion on the workings of FuzzForest will follow, with a focus on the challenges faced during development and our solutions. The highlight of the talk will showcase the results of running the tool on the 20 most popular open-source Python libraries which resulted in identifying dozens of bugs.\r\n\r\nWe will end the talk with an analysis of efficacy and question if we'll all be replaced with a SecurityGPT model soon.\r\n\r\nTo maximize the benefits of this talk, attendees should possess a fundamental understanding of fuzz testing, programming languages, and basic AI concepts.

My research started from reverse-engineering a single RPC method in an OS service and ended with several techniques to abuse a system kernel component, that allow executing programs as “NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM”, as well as other users that are logged on the the machine without triggering any traditional detection algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe various components of the Windows Filtering Platform will be analyzed, such as the Basic Filtering Engine, the TCPIP driver and the IPSec protocol, while focusing on how to abuse them and extract valuable data from them. \r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n- https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/08/understanding-network-access-windows-app.html\r\n- https://scorpiosoftware.net/2022/12/25/introduction-to-the-windows-filtering-platform/\r\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fwp/windows-filtering-platform-architecture-overview\r\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc759130(v=ws.10)","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1687140360,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[50608],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50774],"name":"Ron Ben-Yizhak","affiliations":[{"organization":"Deep Instinct","title":"Security Researcher"}],"pronouns":"he/him","links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@RonB_Y)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/RonB_Y"}],"media":[],"id":49848,"title":"Security Researcher at Deep Instinct"}],"timeband_id":992,"end":"2023-08-13T19:45:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/245779"}],"id":50774,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45589,45592,45629,45630,45646,45766],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691953200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Tool 🛠, Exploit 🪲, Demo 💻","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":49848}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45655,"name":"Caesars Forum -

We will consider other items that have leaked over the years offering similar capabilities, albeit in different circumstances.Examples include Russia’s SORM framework for domestic operations,China’s Great Firewall and (more significantly) Great Cannon programs, and items that emerged in the Snowden leaks such as the US’s alleged “Quantum” program.\r\n\r\nBy analyzing these additional projects, we will observe a decade’s long trend in the systematization and scaling of cyber programs, especially with respect to automated exploitation and infrastructure management.

We will consider other items that have leaked over the years offering similar capabilities, albeit in different circumstances.Examples include Russia’s SORM framework for domestic operations,China’s Great Firewall and (more significantly) Great Cannon programs, and items that emerged in the Snowden leaks such as the US’s alleged “Quantum” program.\r\n\r\nBy analyzing these additional projects, we will observe a decade’s long trend in the systematization and scaling of cyber programs, especially with respect to automated exploitation and infrastructure management. Vulkan and related items, as significant as they are, represent a culmination of operational evolution and an example of the proliferation of capabilities following disclosure.

The challenge will walk participants through how the operational system functions, how it can be negatively impacted, the results of tampering with the system while it’s in flight, and how the system can secured via CIA and PKI.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691101680,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"timeband_id":992,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-13T21:00:00.000-0000","id":52408,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[40280,45646,45743,45775],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691946000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45719,"name":"Caesars Forum - Summit - 208-214 - Aerospace Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Summit - 208-214 - Aerospace Village","id":45859},"begin":"2023-08-13T17:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-03T22:28:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Join us into this collaborative game of OWASP Cornucopia!

BOTBs requires competitors to develop proof-of-concept exploits against varying misconfigured or vulnerable network services. To maximize points scored, the competitor’s bot must automatically scan and compromise network services in the competition environment autonomously. Services that are harder to exploit (ex: requiring memory corruption exploits opposed to misconfigured databases) will result in a higher point score for the competitor. \r\n \r\n The vulnerable network services will include real world vulnerable services where a competitor can adopt off the shelf proof-of-concepts vulnerabilities from an offensive security resource (ex: Metasploit Framework, exploit-db, packetstorm, etc…) into their bot to achieve access to said vulnerable services. Additionally, custom built vulnerable services informed by OWASP Top 10 security bugs as well as CVEs will influence challenge development resulting in a competitor to have the experience of reverse engineering new applications to identify vulnerabilities based on historically significant pain points in Software Engineering as well as infamous historical CVEs. Battle of The Bots will give competitors of all skill levels an opportunity to develop proof-of-concept exploits. Network services will be developed in a variety of compiled and interpreted languages with varying associated vulnerabilities and points.

BOTBs requires competitors to develop proof-of-concept exploits against varying misconfigured or vulnerable network services. To maximize points scored, the competitor’s bot must automatically scan and compromise network services in the competition environment autonomously. Services that are harder to exploit (ex: requiring memory corruption exploits opposed to misconfigured databases) will result in a higher point score for the competitor. \r\n \r\n The vulnerable network services will include real world vulnerable services where a competitor can adopt off the shelf proof-of-concepts vulnerabilities from an offensive security resource (ex: Metasploit Framework, exploit-db, packetstorm, etc…) into their bot to achieve access to said vulnerable services. Additionally, custom built vulnerable services informed by OWASP Top 10 security bugs as well as CVEs will influence challenge development resulting in a competitor to have the experience of reverse engineering new applications to identify vulnerabilities based on historically significant pain points in Software Engineering as well as infamous historical CVEs. Battle of The Bots will give competitors of all skill levels an opportunity to develop proof-of-concept exploits. Network services will be developed in a variety of compiled and interpreted languages with varying associated vulnerabilities and points. The variety of languages will provide opportunities for those less experienced with reverse engineering to analyze vulnerable Python code to find hidden API endpoints that lead to shell execution for example, rather than reverse engineer compiled binaries.\r\n \r\n Finally, the BOTBs team will be capturing network traffic from the competition environment to later be shared with the wider community.

We will also discuss the risks of used devices, for both old and new users.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will talk about the challenges of documenting vacuum robots and developing custom software for them. While our primary goal is to disconnect the robots from the cloud, it is also for users to repair their devices - pwning to own in a wholesome way.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES: \r\n\r\nRobots with lasers and cameras (but no security): Liberating your vacuum from the cloud\r\nhttps://dontvacuum.me/talks/DEFCON29/DEFCON29-Robots_with_lasers_and_cameras.html\r\n  \r\nUnleash your smart-home devices: Vacuum Cleaning Robot Hacking (34C3)\r\nhttps://dontvacuum.me/talks/34c3-2017/34c3.html\r\n  \r\nHaving fun with IoT: Reverse Engineering and Hacking of Xiaomi IoT Devices\r\nhttps://dontvacuum.me/talks/DEFCON26/DEFCON26-Having_fun_with_IoT-Xiaomi.html\r\n  \r\nhttps://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/19/1065306/roomba-irobot-robot-vacuums-artificial-intelligence-training-data-privacy/\r\n  \r\nhttps://linux-sunxi.org/Main_Page","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1687139520,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[50594,51026],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51064,50839],"name":"Dennis Giese","affiliations":[{"organization":"","title":"Hacker"}],"pronouns":"he/him","links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@dgi_DE)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/dgi_DE"},{"description":"","title":"Website","sort_order":0,"url":"https://dontvacuum.me"},{"description":"","title":"Website","sort_order":0,"url":"https://valetudo.cloud"}],"media":[],"id":49829,"title":"Hacker"}],"timeband_id":992,"end":"2023-08-13T17:45:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/245765"}],"id":50839,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45589,45592,45629,45630,45646,45766],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691946000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Tool 🛠, Demo 💻, Exploit 🪲","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":49829}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45694,"name":"Caesars Forum - Academy - 407-410 - Track 4","hotel":"","short_name":"Academy - 407-410 - Track 4","id":45799},"begin":"2023-08-13T17:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-06-19T01:52:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Cellular networks form large complex compounds for roaming purposes.

This Workshop introduces CRTFSS: A methodology to prioritize red team findings using adversary behaviors observed in real-world threat intelligence and mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK based on the most frequent TTPs that score each finding based on the complexity of remediation and exploitability.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1689358320,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[51082],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51114,51137,51138],"name":"Guillermo Buendia","affiliations":[],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@bym0m0)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/bym0m0"}],"media":[],"id":50264}],"timeband_id":991,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-13T00:00:00.000-0000","id":51137,"village_id":60,"tag_ids":[40294,45647,45719],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691881200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45633,"sort_order":2,"person_id":50264}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45681,"name":"Flamingo - Sunset-Twilight Ballroom - Red Team Village - Area 2","hotel":"","short_name":"Area 2","id":45826},"begin":"2023-08-12T23:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-07-14T18:12:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"This workshop is intended for cybersecurity professionals, system administrators, software developers, and anyone interested in learning about the art of hacking web applications and API security.

Additionally, a new technique called Offensive Intel monitors the threat landscape of competitors and provides insights on how to protect our own landscape. The methodology also incorporates techniques to deal with VIP patient data and policies to control staff curiosity. Some real-life use cases will be presented to evidence the effectiveness of the methodology. One such use case involved an almost successful attempt to destroy medical equipment during a penetration testing exercise and how to not do it again. Another one presents vulnerabilities identified in air conditioning controllers, EMR systems, and exam results systems that are used in the entire country. And two incidents that were successfully contained with the help of threat injection and offensive intel. The methodology's effectiveness also led to the inference of the Brazilian TOP 10 Vulnerabilities in the Healthcare Sector, based on findings across systems used throughout the country. The list provides insights into the most critical vulnerabilities facing healthcare institutions in Brazil and will be presented at the conference. The vulnerabilities were categorized by the degree of harm they can inflict on patients and the impact on healthcare services. The methodology's results also drove to the development of a tool that assists other cybersecurity teams in conducting safe red and blue team exercises in the healthcare sector. The tool augments cybersecurity resilience by improving the capabilities of CSIRT and threat intel teams and is valuable to other cybersecurity professionals in the industry. In conclusion, the novel methodology provides a unique approach to enhancing cybersecurity resilience in the Brazilian healthcare sector.

Nowadays, a large number of popular software is built on frameworks based on Chromium, such as CEF and Electron. This means that vulnerabilities in Chromium will directly affect popular software. In addition, according to Google's vulnerability disclosure policy, most of the details of Chromium vulnerabilities will be publicly disclosed 14 weeks after being fixed, and many of these vulnerabilities are high-impact and may lead to RCE. Unfortunately, we have found that much downstream software is unable to timely fix the Chromium vulnerabilities. This creates a window of opportunity for attackers to carry out RCE attacks on popular software. The cost for attackers to exploit these vulnerabilities during this window is relatively low, as it falls between the time of the Chromium vulnerability disclosure and the completion of fixes for popular software. We refer to this window as the \"RCE window period\".\r\n\r\nIn this topic, we will first evaluate the \"RCE window period\" of more than 20 popular software. In the upcoming section, we will showcase how to transform Chromium nday vulnerabilities into popular software 0day vulnerabilities in a low-cost manner within the \"RCE window period\". To illustrate this process, we will use over 10 RCE 0day vulnerabilities in popular software that we have discovered as examples. Some software will attempt to enable sandbox to mitigate this problem, so we will also provide examples of how to bypass the sandbox by exploiting vulnerabilities in the software itself rather than a Chromium sandbox bug.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will discuss the reasons for the existence of the RCE window period and the lessons learned from it, hoping to help software developers improve the security of their products.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n[1] https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2022/06/2022-0-day-in-wild-exploitationso-far.html\r\n[2] https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?q=Type%3DBug-Security&can=2\r\n[3] https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/wiki/GeneralUsage\r\n[4] https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/\r\n[5] https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2027/DEF%20CON%2027%20presentations/DEFCON-27-Junyu-Zhou-and-Ce-Qin-and-Jianing-Wang-Web2Own-Attacking-Desktop-Apps-From-Web-Securitys-Perspective.pdf\r\n[6] https://i.blackhat.com/USA-22/Thursday/US-22-Purani-ElectroVolt-Pwning-Popular-Desktop-Apps.pdf\r\n[7] https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/jcef.html\r\n[8] https://medium.com/@ethicalkid/recent-burp-rce-zeroday-df39b1b24230\r\n[9] https://crbug.com/1307610\r\n[10] https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:external/selinux/libselinux/src/android/android_seapp.c\r\n[11] https://security.googleblog.com/2021/07/protecting-more-with-site-isolation.html\n\n\n","title":"ndays are also 0days: Can hackers launch 0day RCE attack on popular softwares only with chromium ndays?","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-07-15T16:40+0000","color":"#2c8f07","name":"DEF CON Official Talk","id":45589},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691882100,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Chromium is not only the most popular browser in the world but also one of the most widely integrated supply chain components. Nowadays, a large number of popular software is built on frameworks based on Chromium, such as CEF and Electron. This means that vulnerabilities in Chromium will directly affect popular software. In addition, according to Google's vulnerability disclosure policy, most of the details of Chromium vulnerabilities will be publicly disclosed 14 weeks after being fixed, and many of these vulnerabilities are high-impact and may lead to RCE. Unfortunately, we have found that much downstream software is unable to timely fix the Chromium vulnerabilities. This creates a window of opportunity for attackers to carry out RCE attacks on popular software. The cost for attackers to exploit these vulnerabilities during this window is relatively low, as it falls between the time of the Chromium vulnerability disclosure and the completion of fixes for popular software. We refer to this window as the \"RCE window period\".\r\n\r\nIn this topic, we will first evaluate the \"RCE window period\" of more than 20 popular software. In the upcoming section, we will showcase how to transform Chromium nday vulnerabilities into popular software 0day vulnerabilities in a low-cost manner within the \"RCE window period\". To illustrate this process, we will use over 10 RCE 0day vulnerabilities in popular software that we have discovered as examples. Some software will attempt to enable sandbox to mitigate this problem, so we will also provide examples of how to bypass the sandbox by exploiting vulnerabilities in the software itself rather than a Chromium sandbox bug.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will discuss the reasons for the existence of the RCE window period and the lessons learned from it, hoping to help software developers improve the security of their products.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n[1] https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2022/06/2022-0-day-in-wild-exploitationso-far.html\r\n[2] https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?q=Type%3DBug-Security&can=2\r\n[3] https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/wiki/GeneralUsage\r\n[4] https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/\r\n[5] https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2027/DEF%20CON%2027%20presentations/DEFCON-27-Junyu-Zhou-and-Ce-Qin-and-Jianing-Wang-Web2Own-Attacking-Desktop-Apps-From-Web-Securitys-Perspective.pdf\r\n[6] https://i.blackhat.com/USA-22/Thursday/US-22-Purani-ElectroVolt-Pwning-Popular-Desktop-Apps.pdf\r\n[7] https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/jcef.html\r\n[8] https://medium.com/@ethicalkid/recent-burp-rce-zeroday-df39b1b24230\r\n[9] https://crbug.com/1307610\r\n[10] https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:external/selinux/libselinux/src/android/android_seapp.c\r\n[11] https://security.googleblog.com/2021/07/protecting-more-with-site-isolation.html","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1688180640,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[50654],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50821],"name":"Bohan Liu","affiliations":[{"organization":"Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab","title":"Senior Security Researcher"}],"pronouns":"he/him","links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@P4nda20371774)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/P4nda20371774"}],"media":[],"id":49941,"title":"Senior Security Researcher at Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab"},{"content_ids":[50654],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50821],"name":"GuanCheng Li","affiliations":[{"organization":"Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab","title":"Senior Security Researcher"}],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@atuml1)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/atuml1"}],"media":[],"id":49942,"title":"Senior Security Researcher at Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab"},{"content_ids":[50654],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50821],"name":"Zheng Wang","affiliations":[{"organization":"Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab","title":"Senior Security Researcher"}],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@xmzyshypnc)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/xmzyshypnc"}],"media":[],"id":49943,"title":"Senior Security Researcher at Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab"}],"timeband_id":991,"end":"2023-08-12T23:15:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/246107"}],"id":50821,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45589,45592,45629,45646,45766],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691879400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Exploit 🪲, Demo 💻","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":49941},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":4,"person_id":49942},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":6,"person_id":49943}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45655,"name":"Caesars Forum - Forum - 130-134 - Track 3","hotel":"","short_name":"Forum - 130-134 - Track 3","id":45798},"begin":"2023-08-12T22:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-07-01T03:04:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"The Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) is a specialized microcontroller embedded on the motherboard, typically used in servers and other enterprise-level hardware.

The ability to conduct free and fair elections is the cornerstone of any democratic society. However, in recent years, cybercriminals have exploited the vulnerability of social media platforms and unleashed sophisticated phishing attacks to manipulate public opinion and disrupt the democratic process.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we focus on the largest social phishing cyberattacks ever recorded during Brazil's election, where a staggering 156 million individuals were specifically targeted. These attacks, meticulously orchestrated and strategically timed, aimed to deceive and manipulate voters by spreading disinformation, creating confusion, and influencing their decision-making process.\r\n\r\nWe will explore the modus operandi of the cybercriminals behind these attacks, the techniques they employed to infiltrate the social media landscape, and the sophisticated psychological tactics utilized to exploit the vulnerabilities of the unsuspecting public. Moreover, we will analyze the significant consequences of these cyberattacks on the political climate, public trust, and the overall integrity of the electoral process.\r\n\r\nThroughout this presentation, we will also discuss the challenges faced by government authorities, law enforcement agencies, and technology companies in countering such threats. From advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to public awareness campaigns, we will explore various strategies implemented to mitigate the impact of social phishing cyberattacks and safeguard the democratic principles that Brazil holds dear.\r\n\r\nBy examining this case study, we aim to shed light on the growing need for enhanced cybersecurity measures, international collaboration, and comprehensive policies to prevent the recurrence of such incidents in future elections, not only in Brazil but also across the globe.

In particular, we found code execution vulnerabilities exploitable through NFC when handling a special application protocol data unit (APDU) that affect most NFC payment vendors. The vulnerabilities affect baremetal firmware devices and Android/Linux devices as well.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting more than 1 year and a half once we disclosed it to all the affected vendors, we are ready to disclose all the technical details to the public. This research was covered in the media by wired.com but without the technical details that we can share now\r\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/atm-hack-nfc-bugs-point-of-sale/\r\n\r\nSome of the affected vendors are:\r\nIDtech - https://idtechproducts.com/\r\nIngenico - https://www.ingenico.com/\r\nVerifone - https://www.verifone.com/\r\nCPI - https://www.cranepi.com/\r\nBBPOS - https://www.bbpos.com/\r\nWiseasy - https://www.wiseasy.com/\r\nNexgo - https://www.nexgoglobal.com/\r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will describe the vulnerabilities and also demo how the readers can be compromised, using a special Android app we created, by just tapping an Android phone to the reader. We will discuss the consequences such as financial impact in reader’s users/owners and card data stealing once the firmware is compromised. Also, we will show how to compromise the host that is connected to the reader through USB by manipulating the reader’s firmware, chaining stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the SDK provided by the vendor that is running in the host machine.\r\n\r\nFinally, since one of the affected vendors (IDtech) is present in most ATM brands in the world, the talk will cover different scenarios of how possible can be jackpotting ATMs just tapping a smartphone into the reader of the ATM.

The vulnerabilities affect baremetal firmware devices and Android/Linux devices as well.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting more than 1 year and a half once we disclosed it to all the affected vendors, we are ready to disclose all the technical details to the public. This research was covered in the media by wired.com but without the technical details that we can share now\r\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/atm-hack-nfc-bugs-point-of-sale/\r\n\r\nSome of the affected vendors are:\r\nIDtech - https://idtechproducts.com/\r\nIngenico - https://www.ingenico.com/\r\nVerifone - https://www.verifone.com/\r\nCPI - https://www.cranepi.com/\r\nBBPOS - https://www.bbpos.com/\r\nWiseasy - https://www.wiseasy.com/\r\nNexgo - https://www.nexgoglobal.com/\r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will describe the vulnerabilities and also demo how the readers can be compromised, using a special Android app we created, by just tapping an Android phone to the reader. We will discuss the consequences such as financial impact in reader’s users/owners and card data stealing once the firmware is compromised. Also, we will show how to compromise the host that is connected to the reader through USB by manipulating the reader’s firmware, chaining stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the SDK provided by the vendor that is running in the host machine.\r\n\r\nFinally, since one of the affected vendors (IDtech) is present in most ATM brands in the world, the talk will cover different scenarios of how possible can be jackpotting ATMs just tapping a smartphone into the reader of the ATM. We have many years of experience jackpotting all brands of ATMs in multiple different ways and we will show how this is technically possible.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1687140420,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[50569],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50808],"name":"Josep Pi Rodriguez","affiliations":[{"organization":"IOActive","title":"Principal Security Consultant"}],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@Josep_pi)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/Josep_pi"}],"media":[],"id":49787,"title":"Principal Security Consultant at IOActive"}],"timeband_id":991,"end":"2023-08-12T22:15:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/245740"}],"id":50808,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45589,45592,45629,45646,45766],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691875800,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Exploit 🪲, Demo 💻","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":49787}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45655,"name":"Caesars Forum - Forum - 130-134 - Track 3","hotel":"","short_name":"Forum - 130-134 - Track 3","id":45798},"begin":"2023-08-12T21:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-06-19T02:07:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"OPC-UA is the most popular protocol today in ICS/SCADA and IoT environments for data exchanges from sensors to on-premises or cloud applications.

Creative women often do well in the Freestyle category.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1690317600,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"timeband_id":991,"end":"2023-08-12T23:00:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Website","type":"link","url":"https://dcbeard.net"},{"label":"Twitter (@DCBeardContest)","type":"link","url":"https://twitter.com/DCBeardContest"}],"id":51602,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45635,45646,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691874000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45719,"name":"Caesars Forum - Summit - Contest Area","hotel":"","short_name":"Summit - Contest Area","id":45855},"begin":"2023-08-12T21:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-07-25T20:40:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"","title":"Lonely Hackers Club - Badgelife & Sticker Swap","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-07-15T16:40+0000","color":"#77d8b8","name":"Misc","id":45640},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691884800,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1690163160,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"timeband_id":991,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-13T00:00:00.000-0000","id":51590,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45640,45648,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691874000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45668,"name":"Harrah's - Laughlin - Lonely Hackers Club","hotel":"","short_name":"Laughlin - Lonely Hackers Club","id":45898},"begin":"2023-08-12T21:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-07-24T01:46:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"","title":"Easy EASM - the zero dollar attack surface management tool","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-07-15T16:40+0000","color":"#d86e9f","name":"Village Talk","id":45645},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691875500,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1689553020,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[51097,51303,51307,51998,52118],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51128,51365,51369,52192,52342],"name":"Jason Haddix","affiliations":[{"organization":"BuddoBot","title":"CISO and “Hacker in Charge”"}],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@jhaddix)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/jhaddix"}],"media":[],"id":50266,"title":"CISO and “Hacker in Charge” at BuddoBot"}],"timeband_id":991,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-12T21:25:00.000-0000","id":51369,"village_id":59,"tag_ids":[40293,45645,45649,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691874000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":50266}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45738,"name":"LINQ - 3rd flr - Social B and C - Recon Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Social B and C - Recon Village","id":45737},"begin":"2023-08-12T21:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-07-17T00:17:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"In order to threat hunt, in order to create threat intelligence, one must first identify the what before the where, the where, before the why, the why before the who, and then you’ll know who attacked you…maybe 🙂 In this CTF style threat hunt, you are placed in two seats.

Depending on your comfort level with this, bring a \"burner\" laptop, use a clean drive, or plan on doing a clean install before and after the workshop.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1688054160,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[50559,50619],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50727,50805],"name":"Wesley McGrew","affiliations":[{"organization":"MartinFed","title":"Senior Cyber Fellow"}],"pronouns":"he/him","links":[{"description":"","title":"Mastodon (@mcgrew@defcon.social)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://defcon.social/@mcgrew"},{"description":"","title":"Mixcloud","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.mixcloud.com/wesmcgrew/stream/"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@McGrewSecurity)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/McGrewSecurity"}],"media":[],"id":49770,"title":"Senior Cyber Fellow at MartinFed"}],"timeband_id":991,"end":"2023-08-13T01:00:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Registration","type":"link","url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/wes-mcgrew-the-joy-of-reverse-engineering-learning-with-ghidra-and-windb-tickets-668400352447"}],"id":50727,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45634,45652,45743,45877],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691874000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":49770}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45665,"name":"Flamingo - Exec Conf Ctr - Foyer - Workshop Checkin","hotel":"","short_name":"Foyer - Workshop Checkin","id":45755},"begin":"2023-08-12T21:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-06-29T15:56:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Let's break out Wireshark and dig deep in to the TCP and IP protocols.

To address this issue, the National Democratic Institute developed a set of solutions-based interventions for technology platforms to end online violence against women in politics and public life. The interventions were developed in collaboration with a global network of women survivors. In order to more successfully advocate for the implementation of these interventions, research and advocacy efforts are needed to demonstrate the power and profitability of providing a safe space for women to politically engage online.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691435640,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[52330,52332],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52614,52616],"name":"Eric Davis","affiliations":[],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericdavis1"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@ericdavis)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/ericdavis"}],"media":[],"id":51539},{"content_ids":[52329,52332],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52613,52616],"name":"Hallie Stern","affiliations":[],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/halliejstern"}],"media":[],"id":51541},{"content_ids":[52332],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52616],"name":"Omri Preiss","affiliations":[],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Link","sort_order":0,"url":"https://alliance4europe.eu/team-board"},{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/omri-preiss-3583a426/"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@OmriPreiss)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/OmriPreiss"}],"media":[],"id":51553},{"content_ids":[52332],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52616],"name":"Theodora Skeadas","affiliations":[],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Link","sort_order":0,"url":"https://elections.harvard.edu/people/theodora-skeadas"},{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/theodora-skeadas"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@theodoraskeadas)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/theodoraskeadas"}],"media":[],"id":51558}],"timeband_id":991,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-12T21:20:00.000-0000","id":52616,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[40298,45646,45743,45771],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691872200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":2,"person_id":51539},{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":4,"person_id":51541},{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":6,"person_id":51553},{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":8,"person_id":51558}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45694,"name":"Caesars Forum - Academy - 415-418 - Voting Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Academy - 415-418 - Voting Village","id":45872},"begin":"2023-08-12T20:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-07T19:14:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"The participatory paper presents the usual functioning of the Russian propaganda and disinformation ecosystem, as well as the possible indicators exhibited both by the Russian unofficial media and by its journalists/researchers, in those narratives especially focused on the Spanish-speaking public, showing concrete examples from several Latin American countries of this modus operandi.\n\n\n","title":"Main features of Russia's disinformation and propaganda ecosystem in Spanish-speaking countries","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-07-15T16:40+0000","color":"#f7375a","name":"Village Workshop","id":45719},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691875800,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"The participatory paper presents the usual functioning of the Russian propaganda and disinformation ecosystem, as well as the possible indicators exhibited both by the Russian unofficial media and by its journalists/researchers, in those narratives especially focused on the Spanish-speaking public, showing concrete examples from several Latin American countries of this modus operandi.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691284740,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[52281],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52545],"name":"Carlos Galán","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51498}],"timeband_id":991,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-12T21:30:00.000-0000","id":52545,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[40305,45646,45719,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691872200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":2,"person_id":51498}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45719,"name":"Caesars Forum - Summit - 224 - Misinfo Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Summit - 224 - Misinfo Village","id":45856},"begin":"2023-08-12T20:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-06T01:19:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":".\n\n\nA brief view into the odd world of Operational Technology (OT) and why so many OT Security Engineers drink like they hate themselves.

Finally, we will also include best practices and recommendations on how defenders can implement policy and configuration changes that help mitigate these issues.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1690921200,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[51985],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52179],"name":"Karl Fosaaen","affiliations":[{"organization":"NetSPI","title":"VP of Research"}],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@kfosaaen)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/kfosaaen"}],"media":[],"id":51190,"title":"VP of Research at NetSPI"},{"content_ids":[51985],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52179],"name":"Thomas Elling","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51191}],"timeband_id":991,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-12T21:10:00.000-0000","id":52179,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[40284,45645,45647,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691872200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":51190},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":4,"person_id":51191}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45703,"name":"Flamingo - Mesquite - Cloud Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Mesquite - Cloud Village","id":45653},"begin":"2023-08-12T20:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-01T20:20:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Cold Calls give attendees a walk-up opportunity to make a short call to get a feel for both the contest and the world of Social Engineering through vishing but without the contest elements.\r\n\r\nThis is on a first-come, first-served basis.

To maximize the accuracy of a QNN on a Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computer, approximate synthesis modifies the QNN circuit by reducing error-prone 2-qubit quantum gates. The success of QNNs motivates adversaries to attack QNNs via backdoors. However, na¨ıvely transplanting backdoors designed for classical neural networks to QNNs yields only low attack success rate, due to the noises and approximate synthesis on NISQ computers. Prior quantum circuit-based backdoors cannot selectively attack some inputs or work with all types of encoding layers of a QNN circuit. Moreover, it is easy to detect both transplanted and circuit-based backdoors in a QNN. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we introduce a novel and stealthy backdoor attack, QDoor, to achieve high attack success rate in approximately-synthesized QNN circuits by weaponizing unitary differences between uncompiled QNNs and their synthesized counterparts. QDoor trains a QNN behaving normally for all inputs with and without a trigger. However, after approximate synthesis, the QNN circuit always predicts any inputs with a trigger to a predefined class while still acts normally for benign inputs. Compared to prior backdoor attacks, QDoor improves the attack success rate by 13× and the clean data accuracy by 65% on average. Furthermore, prior backdoor detection techniques cannot find QDoor attacks in uncompiled QNN circuits.\n\n\n","title":"QDoor: Exploiting Approximate Synthesis for Backdoor Attacks in Quantum Neural Networks","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-07-15T16:40+0000","color":"#d86e9f","name":"Village Talk","id":45645},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691874000,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Quantum neural networks (QNNs) succeed in object recognition, natural language processing, and financial analysis.

By speculating about the possible future uses of technologies under development, science fiction shows us plausible futures. In this sense, it allows us, as a society, to popularize and debate the consequences (expected or not) of our technological developments. In addition to this not negligible social role science fiction also has an impact on our current developments. We speak here of \"loop-looping\", i.e. there is a feedback loop between what science fiction shows us and what we are then led to actually develop. From this point of view, our imaginations are performative, and this is perhaps the most critical issue: what I see can happen. In the case of hacking and cybersecurity, a particular phenomenon is added: the general public's knowledge of these subjects is mainly through the fictions they watch, read, or listen to. We propose to analyze a corpus of 200 fictional attacks, and 800 real attacks and to compare them to define if the imaginary ones are predictive if they inform us or on the contrary mislead us as for the reality of the current attacks.  \r\n\r\nREFERENCES: \r\n\r\nThe subject of imaginaries is a key subject of the work of the Making Tomorrow collective co-founded by Nicolas Minvielle. As such, he has been able to conduct numerous studies aimed at analyzing the impact of science fiction on a given practice.\r\n\r\nA book has been published on the subject and is available online in pdf format:\r\nMinvielle, N. & Wathelet, O. & Lauquin, M. & Audinet, P., Design fiction for your organization, Making Tomorrow (2020), http://making-tomorrow.mkrs.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Making-Tomorrow-Design-Fiction-and-more-for-your-organization.pdf   \r\n\r\nAcademic references on this subject: \r\n \r\nBrake, Mark, and Neil Hook, Different Engines: How Science Drives Fiction and Fiction Drives Science (London New York: Macmillan, 2008)\r\n \r\nCarpenter, C.

By speculating about the possible future uses of technologies under development, science fiction shows us plausible futures. In this sense, it allows us, as a society, to popularize and debate the consequences (expected or not) of our technological developments. In addition to this not negligible social role science fiction also has an impact on our current developments. We speak here of \"loop-looping\", i.e. there is a feedback loop between what science fiction shows us and what we are then led to actually develop. From this point of view, our imaginations are performative, and this is perhaps the most critical issue: what I see can happen. In the case of hacking and cybersecurity, a particular phenomenon is added: the general public's knowledge of these subjects is mainly through the fictions they watch, read, or listen to. We propose to analyze a corpus of 200 fictional attacks, and 800 real attacks and to compare them to define if the imaginary ones are predictive if they inform us or on the contrary mislead us as for the reality of the current attacks.  \r\n\r\nREFERENCES: \r\n\r\nThe subject of imaginaries is a key subject of the work of the Making Tomorrow collective co-founded by Nicolas Minvielle. As such, he has been able to conduct numerous studies aimed at analyzing the impact of science fiction on a given practice.\r\n\r\nA book has been published on the subject and is available online in pdf format:\r\nMinvielle, N. & Wathelet, O. & Lauquin, M. & Audinet, P., Design fiction for your organization, Making Tomorrow (2020), http://making-tomorrow.mkrs.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Making-Tomorrow-Design-Fiction-and-more-for-your-organization.pdf   \r\n\r\nAcademic references on this subject: \r\n \r\nBrake, Mark, and Neil Hook, Different Engines: How Science Drives Fiction and Fiction Drives Science (London New York: Macmillan, 2008)\r\n \r\nCarpenter, C.

You'll come away with a new appreciation for the challenges and rewards of this fascinating field and a deeper understanding of its role in keeping us all safe and secure.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1690921140,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[51984],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52178],"name":"Liv Matan","affiliations":[{"organization":"Ermetic","title":"Cloud Security Researcher"}],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@terminatorLM)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/terminatorLM"}],"media":[],"id":51189,"title":"Cloud Security Researcher at Ermetic"}],"timeband_id":991,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-12T20:00:00.000-0000","id":52178,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[40284,45645,45647,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691868000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":51189}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45703,"name":"Flamingo - Mesquite - Cloud Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Mesquite - Cloud Village","id":45653},"begin":"2023-08-12T19:20:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-01T20:19:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"","title":"How I Built Recon to Scale with Serverless Architecture","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-07-15T16:40+0000","color":"#d86e9f","name":"Village Talk","id":45645},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691869800,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1689553020,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[51306,51998],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51368,52192],"name":"Gunnar Andrews","affiliations":[],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@G0LDEN_infosec)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/G0LDEN_infosec"}],"media":[],"id":50458}],"timeband_id":991,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-12T19:50:00.000-0000","id":51368,"village_id":59,"tag_ids":[40293,45645,45649,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691867100,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":50458}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45738,"name":"LINQ - 3rd flr - Social B and C - Recon Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Social B and C - Recon Village","id":45737},"begin":"2023-08-12T19:05:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-07-17T00:17:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"","title":"RFID Hacking","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-07-15T16:40+0000","color":"#d86e9f","name":"Village Talk","id":45645},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691868600,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691565120,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[52388,52392,52397],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52688,52679,52683],"name":"Ege","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51607}],"timeband_id":991,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-12T19:30:00.000-0000","id":52679,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[40290,45645,45647,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691866800,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":51607}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45703,"name":"Flamingo - Carson City - Physical Security Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Carson City - Physical Security Village","id":45679},"begin":"2023-08-12T19:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-09T07:12:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Capture The Packet is returning to DEF CON!

This new technique allowed attackers to sidestep codesigning, ASLR, and all other mitigations to execute arbitrary code on Apple devices. As a result, Apple put in place new restrictions to make NSPredicate less powerful and less useful for exploits.

As part of this talk we will explore opportunities for the DEFCON community to work together to ensure mission-critical AI systems are battle-tested with the rigor and scrutiny of real-world adversaries.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691031420,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[52055],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52274],"name":"Daniel Fabian","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51280},{"content_ids":[52055],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52274],"name":"Mikel Rodriguez","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51288},{"content_ids":[52055],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52274],"name":"Sarah Hodkinson","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51294}],"timeband_id":991,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-12T18:25:00.000-0000","id":52274,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[40299,45645,45646,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691861400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":51280},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":4,"person_id":51288},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":6,"person_id":51294}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45694,"name":"Caesars Forum - Academy - 401-406 - AI Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Academy - 401-406 - AI Village","id":45870},"begin":"2023-08-12T17:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-03T02:57:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"","title":"Intro to Ciphers","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-07-15T16:40+0000","color":"#f7375a","name":"Village Workshop","id":45719},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691862300,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691026020,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[52022,52029,52030,52031,52037,52040,52043],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52238,52247,52246,52245,52253,52259,52256,52260,52261,52262],"name":"CPV Staff","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51254}],"timeband_id":991,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-12T17:45:00.000-0000","id":52261,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[40308,45647,45719,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691861400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":51254}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45703,"name":"Flamingo - Sunset - Vista - Crypto & Privacy Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Sunset - Vista - Crypto & Privacy Village","id":45702},"begin":"2023-08-12T17:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-03T01:27:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Security monitoring in any environment is made or broken by the signal quality in the event logs.\r\nCloud-based solutions have transformed the computing landscape with advantages like on-demand resource availability, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and enhanced collaboration capabilities.

It will also aim to identify policy solutions and overall recommendations to generate more secure environments for communities at risk.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1690431000,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[51511],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51667],"name":"Adrien Ogee","affiliations":[{"organization":"CyberPeace Institute","title":"Chief Operations Officer"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50570,"title":"Chief Operations Officer at CyberPeace Institute"},{"content_ids":[51511,51527],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51667,51683],"name":"David Forscey","affiliations":[{"organization":"CISA JCDC","title":"Cyber Strategy Planner"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50597,"title":"Cyber Strategy Planner at CISA JCDC"},{"content_ids":[51511],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51667],"name":"Mark E.

This unique competition is designed to replicate enterprise infrastructure and present participants with challenges that encourage the adoption of various techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) employed by real adversaries and threat actors, all within a defined time frame.\r\n\r\nAdversary Village is a community-driven initiative that prioritizes adversary simulation, emulation, breach and attack simulation, adversary tactics, offensive/adversary tradecraft, philosophy, and purple teaming.\r\n\r\nOur objective is to establish a Capture the Flag competition dedicated to adversary simulation, purple teaming and knowledge sharing. Adversary Wars offers unique opportunities for “adversaries” aka participants to simulate attacks, explore new attack vectors, gain insights into threat actor profiles, master TTPs, and refine offensive tradecraft.

We'll also highlight design weaknesses that malicious code could trivially employ to sidestep the new security features of BTM, such that persistence may still be silently achieved.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\nhttps://piunikaweb.com/2023/01/30/macos-13-ventura-background-items-added-notification-issue/\r\nhttps://www.sentinelone.com/blog/apples-macos-ventura-7-new-security-changes-to-be-aware-of/\r\n\r\nApple Documentation:\r\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/manage-login-items-background-tasks-mac-depdca572563/web","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1687137180,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[50558,50607],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50773,50783],"name":"Patrick Wardle","affiliations":[{"organization":"Objective-See Foundation","title":""}],"pronouns":"he/him","links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@patrickwardle)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/patrickwardle"},{"description":"","title":"Website","sort_order":0,"url":"https://objective-see.org"}],"media":[],"id":49769,"title":"Objective-See Foundation"}],"timeband_id":991,"end":"2023-08-12T17:45:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"YouTube","type":"link","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOoqEVhvNw8"},{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/245729"}],"id":50783,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45589,45592,45630,45646,45766],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691859600,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Demo 💻, Tool 🛠","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":49769}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45655,"name":"Caesars Forum - Forum - 109-119, 138-139 - Track 2","hotel":"","short_name":"Forum - 109-119, 138-139 - Track 2","id":45797},"begin":"2023-08-12T17:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-06-19T01:13:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Socially engineering a target organization with a hard hat and safety vest never gets old, but there are more ways to the server room.

The lights on the buttons will change color depending on availibility.\r\n\r\nA green light means the VM is available and ready.\r\n\r\nAn amber light requests the user to insert more money to ensure fair distribution according to current resources.\r\n\r\nA red light denotes the selection is unavailable.\r\n\r\nOnce you make a selection, the system will deploy the VM to the network and a receipt will be printed.\r\n\r\nOn the receipt, login credentials are provided for you to access your virtual machine via remote shell. You are then able to change the password, install whatever tools and applications you need, making the VM your own.\r\n\r\nWhat you do with the VM is up to you. Should you choose to share your virtual machine with someone outside of the DEF CON network, a Tor address is provided as well.\r\n\r\nAll proceeds go to the National Upcycled Computing Collective, Inc., a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization helping further research and education in computer science, technology and engineering as an (NTEE U41) Research Institute.\r\n\r\nWe accept donations: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/NUCC","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1690997580,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"timeband_id":991,"end":"2023-08-13T09:00:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Mastodon (@soda@defcon.social)","type":"link","url":"https://defcon.social/@soda"},{"label":"Twitter (@ShellsOnDemand)","type":"link","url":"https://twitter.com/ShellsOnDemand"}],"id":52211,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45640,45646,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691856000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"Y","location":{"parent_id":45655,"name":"Caesars Forum - Forum - 121-123, 129, 137 - Chillout","hotel":"","short_name":"Forum - 121-123, 129, 137 - Chillout","id":45854},"begin":"2023-08-12T16:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-02T17:33:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"All merch sales are USD CASH ONLY.

Blue teams on the stage will also see some ideas regarding detections.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1687138920,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[50587],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50816],"name":"Wojciech Reguła","affiliations":[{"organization":"SecuRing","title":"Principal Security Consultant"}],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/wojciech-regula/"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@_r3ggi)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/_r3ggi"},{"description":"","title":"Website","sort_order":0,"url":"https://wojciechregula.blog"}],"media":[],"id":49819,"title":"Principal Security Consultant at SecuRing"}],"timeband_id":991,"end":"2023-08-12T16:20:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/245758"}],"id":50816,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45589,45592,45630,45646,45766],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691856000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Demo 💻, Tool 🛠","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":49819}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45655,"name":"Caesars Forum - Forum - 130-134 - Track 3","hotel":"","short_name":"Forum - 130-134 - Track 3","id":45798},"begin":"2023-08-12T16:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-06-19T01:42:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"For too long, web race-condition attacks have focused on a tiny handful of scenarios.

This talk will go over a PoC where we put it to the test.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1689115920,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[51045],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51077],"name":"Om Mahida","affiliations":[{"organization":"MedCrypt","title":""}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50230,"title":"MedCrypt"}],"timeband_id":990,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-12T01:00:00.000-0000","id":51077,"village_id":68,"tag_ids":[45645,45647,45717],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691799600,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":50230}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45703,"name":"Flamingo - Laughlin I,II,III - Biohacking Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Laughlin I,II,III - Biohacking Village","id":45663},"begin":"2023-08-12T00:20:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-07-11T22:52:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Rafal Janik will argue for the proposition Konstantinos Karagiannis will argue against\r\n\r\nfor each talk: Opening - Bob introduces the topic 5 mins - speaker FOR the proposition 5 mins - speaker AGAINST the proposition ~10mins - rebuttals ~15mins - audience questions/comments 5 minis Vote & results and wrap up.\n\n\n","title":"Debate: NISQ and the future of Quantum Advantage: This village believes the current state of NISQ is already enabling quantum advantage for those who know how to use these technologies","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-07-15T16:40+0000","color":"#d86e9f","name":"Village Talk","id":45645},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691802000,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Rafal Janik will argue for the proposition Konstantinos Karagiannis will argue against\r\n\r\nfor each talk: Opening - Bob introduces the topic 5 mins - speaker FOR the proposition 5 mins - speaker AGAINST the proposition ~10mins - rebuttals ~15mins - audience questions/comments 5 minis Vote & results and wrap up.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691795760,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[52180,52412],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52708,52428],"name":"Konstantinos Karagiannis","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51429},{"content_ids":[52404,52412],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52708,52699],"name":"Rafal Janik","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51623}],"timeband_id":990,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-12T01:00:00.000-0000","id":52708,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[40291,45645,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691799300,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":51429},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":4,"person_id":51623}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45738,"name":"LINQ - 3rd flr - Quantum Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Quantum Village","id":45741},"begin":"2023-08-12T00:15:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-11T23:16:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Join the Founders of the Social Engineering Community as they break down this year’s Vishing Competition (#SECVC).

HL7Magic will be open sourced and collaborations to improve it further will be welcomed.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES: \r\n\r\nForescout - Connected Medical Device Security: https://www.forescout.com/resources/connected-medical-device-security-a-deep-dive-into-healthcare-networks/\r\n\r\nDallas Haselhorst - HL7 Medical Attacking and Defending: https://linuxincluded.com/hl7-medical-attacking-defending/\r\n\r\nAnirudh Duggal - Understanding HL7 2.X Standards, Pen Testing and Defending HL7 2.X Messages: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR7cH44fjrc\r\n \r\nSaurabh Harit - Breaking Bad: Stealing Patient Data Through Medical Devices: https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-17/materials/eu-17-Harit-Breaking-Bad-Stealing-Patient-Data-Through-Medical-Devices.pdf\r\n \r\nChristian Dameff, Maxwell Bland, Kirill Levchenko, Jeff Tully - Pestilential Protocol: How Unsecure HL7 Messages Threaten Patient Lives: https://i.blackhat.com/us-18/Thu-August-9/us-18-Dameff-Pestilential-Protocol-How-Unsecure-HL7-Messages-Threaten-Patient-Lives-wp.pdf\r\n \r\nHL7apy: https://crs4.github.io/hl7apy/tutorial/index.html#","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1687137420,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[50562],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50784],"name":"Katie Inns","affiliations":[{"organization":"WithSecure","title":"Security Consultant"}],"pronouns":"she/her","links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/katie-inns/"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@J3lly____)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/J3lly____"}],"media":[],"id":49776,"title":"Security Consultant at WithSecure"}],"timeband_id":990,"end":"2023-08-12T00:20:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/245733"}],"id":50784,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45589,45592,45630,45646,45766],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691798400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Demo 💻, Tool 🛠","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":49776}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45655,"name":"Caesars Forum - Forum - 109-119, 138-139 - Track 2","hotel":"","short_name":"Forum - 109-119, 138-139 - Track 2","id":45797},"begin":"2023-08-12T00:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-06-19T01:17:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"In this session we will cover what can be done to secure elections leading up to 2024.

However, to get the most out of the talk, attendees are encouraged to have a basic understanding of general Windows architecture, networking, and programming concepts. \r\n\r\nREFERENCES: \r\n[1] Pyle, Ned. “The Beginning of the End of Remote Mailslots.” Tech Community, Microsoft, 8 Mar. 2023, https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/storage-at-microsoft/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-remote-mailslots/ba-p/3762048.\r\n \r\n[2] Corporation, Microsoft. “[MS-Mail]: Remote Mailslot Protocol.” [MS-MAIL], Microsoft, 25 June 2021, https://winprotocoldoc.blob.core.windows.net/productionwindowsarchives/MS-MAIL/[MS-MAIL].pdf.\r\n \r\n[3] Aggarwal, Avnish. “PROTOCOL STANDARD FOR A NetBIOS SERVICE.” IETF, RFC Editor, Mar. 1987, https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1001.\r\n \r\n[4] ATT&CK, MITRE. “Enterprise Techniques.” Techniques - Enterprise ,\r\nMITRE ATT&CK, MITRE ATTCK, 25 Oct. 2022, https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/.\r\n \r\n[5] Yosifovich, Author Pavel. “Parent Process vs. Creator Process.” Pavel Yosifovich, 10 Jan. 2021, https://scorpiosoftware.net/2021/01/10/parent-process-vs-creator-process/.\r\n \r\n[6] Schwarz, Roland. “Thread Local Storage - the C++ WAY.” CodeProject, CodeProject, 28 Aug. 2004, https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/8113/Thread-Local-Storage-The-C-Way.\r\n \r\n[7] The Chromium Authors. “Chromium/thread_local_storage_win.Cc at Main · Chromium/Chromium.” GitHub, The Chromium Project, Jan. 2012, https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/main/base/threading/thread_local_storage_win.cc.\r\n \r\n[8] timb3r. “How to Find Hidden Threads - Threadhidefromdebugger - Antidebug Trick.” How to Find Hidden Threads - ThreadHideFromDebugger - AntiDebug Trick, Guided Hacking, 27 Dec. 2019, https://guidedhacking.com/threads/how-to-find-hidden-threads-threadhidefromdebugger-antidebug-trick.14281/.\r\n \r\n[9] Chappell, Geoff. “THREADINFOCLASS.” Threadinfoclass, Jan. 1997, https://www.geoffchappell.com/studies/windows/km/ntoskrnl/api/ps/psquery/class.htm.\r\n \r\n[10] GrantMeStrength. “GetMailslotInfo Function (Winbase.h) - win32 Apps.” Win32 Apps ,\r\nMicrosoft Learn, 10 Oct. 2021, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getmailslotinfo.\r\n \r\n[11] Alvinashcraft. “Impersonation Tokens - win32 Apps.” Win32 Apps ,\r\nMicrosoft Learn, 1 July 2021, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/impersonation-tokens.\r\n \r\n[12] GrantMeStrength. “CreateProcessWithTokenW Function (Winbase.h) - win32 Apps.” Win32 Apps ,\r\nMicrosoft Learn, 2 Jan. 2023, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-createprocesswithtokenw.\r\n \r\n[13] QuinnRadich. “WTSQUERYUSERTOKEN Function (WTSAPI32.H) - win32 Apps.” Win32 Apps ,\r\nMicrosoft Learn, 10 Dec. 2021, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wtsapi32/nf-wtsapi32-wtsqueryusertoken.\r\n \r\n[14] Karl-Bridge-Microsoft. “PEB (Winternl.h) - win32 Apps.” PEB (Winternl.h) - Win32 Apps ,\r\nMicrosoft Learn, 31 Aug. 2022, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/ns-winternl-peb.\r\n \r\n[15] Yosifovich, Pavel.

Yet tooling to analyze shellcode is lacking. We present the cutting-edge SHAREM framework to analyze enigmatic shellcode.\r\n\r\nSHAREM can emulate shellcode, identifying 20,000 WinAPI functions and 99% of Windows syscalls.  In some shellcode, some APIs may never be reached, due to the wrong environment, but SHAREM has a new solution: Complete code coverage preserves the CPU register context and memory at each change in control flow. Once the shellcode ends, it restarts, restoring memory and context, ensuring all functionality is reached and identifying all APIs.\r\n\r\nEncoded shellcode may be puzzling at times. SHAREM is a game-changer, as it presents emulated shellcode in its decoded form in a disassembler.\r\n\r\nIDA Pro and Ghidra can produce disassembly of shellcode that is of poor quality. However, SHAREM uniquely can ingest emulation data, resulting in virtually flawless disassembly. While SHAREM has its own custom disassembler, we are also releasing a Ghidra plugin, so SHAREM's enhanced disassembly can enhance what is in GHidra. Only SHAREM identifies APIs in disassembly, and this also can be brought to Ghidra.\r\n\r\nWe will also see how SHAREM can be used by aspiring shellcode authors to enhance their own work, and we will examine advanced shellcode specimens in SHAREM. | Dr. Bramwell Brizendine completed his Ph.D. in Cyber Operations, for which he did his dissertation on Jump-Oriented Programming, a hitherto seldom-studied and poorly understood subset of code-reuse attacks.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n[1] Mds.

Yet tooling to analyze shellcode is lacking. We present the cutting-edge SHAREM framework to analyze enigmatic shellcode.\r\n\r\nSHAREM can emulate shellcode, identifying 20,000 WinAPI functions and 99% of Windows syscalls.  In some shellcode, some APIs may never be reached, due to the wrong environment, but SHAREM has a new solution: Complete code coverage preserves the CPU register context and memory at each change in control flow. Once the shellcode ends, it restarts, restoring memory and context, ensuring all functionality is reached and identifying all APIs.\r\n\r\nEncoded shellcode may be puzzling at times. SHAREM is a game-changer, as it presents emulated shellcode in its decoded form in a disassembler.\r\n\r\nIDA Pro and Ghidra can produce disassembly of shellcode that is of poor quality. However, SHAREM uniquely can ingest emulation data, resulting in virtually flawless disassembly. While SHAREM has its own custom disassembler, we are also releasing a Ghidra plugin, so SHAREM's enhanced disassembly can enhance what is in GHidra. Only SHAREM identifies APIs in disassembly, and this also can be brought to Ghidra.\r\n\r\nWe will also see how SHAREM can be used by aspiring shellcode authors to enhance their own work, and we will examine advanced shellcode specimens in SHAREM. | Dr. Bramwell Brizendine completed his Ph.D. in Cyber Operations, for which he did his dissertation on Jump-Oriented Programming, a hitherto seldom-studied and poorly understood subset of code-reuse attacks.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n[1] Mds.

Different software versions are blamed for the irregularities observed in Antrim country in 2021. An unreasonably slow update process of the online voter register in Estonia let to 63 voters casting incorrect electronic ballots that needed to be removed by court order from the digital ballot box. A slow voting machine repair process left thousands of voters waiting to cast their vote in the Philippines in 2022.

So we will also have an opportunity to explore other ways to apply it to the work of others.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691284680,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[52278],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52542],"name":"Joel Benge","affiliations":[{"organization":"MessageSpec Consulting","title":""}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51504,"title":"MessageSpec Consulting"}],"timeband_id":990,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-11T22:30:00.000-0000","id":52542,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[40305,45646,45719,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691789400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":2,"person_id":51504}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45719,"name":"Caesars Forum - Summit - 224 - Misinfo Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Summit - 224 - Misinfo Village","id":45856},"begin":"2023-08-11T21:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-06T01:18:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"","title":"SS7 Workshop","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-07-15T16:40+0000","color":"#f7375a","name":"Village Workshop","id":45719},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691794800,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691257140,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[52238,52239,52241,52242],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52493,52494,52496,52497,52500,52501],"name":"Zibran Sayyed","affiliations":[{"organization":"","title":"Sr. Security Consultant Telecom"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51522,"title":"Sr. Security Consultant Telecom"},{"content_ids":[52238,52239,52241,52242,52243],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52493,52494,52496,52497,52500,52501,52498],"name":"Akib Sayyed","affiliations":[{"organization":"Matrix Shell Technologies Prviate Limited","title":"Director"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51524,"title":"Director at Matrix Shell Technologies Prviate Limited"}],"timeband_id":990,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-11T23:00:00.000-0000","id":52500,"village_id":72,"tag_ids":[40304,45647,45719,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691789400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45633,"sort_order":2,"person_id":51524},{"tag_id":45633,"sort_order":4,"person_id":51522}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45703,"name":"Flamingo - Virginia City - Telecom Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Virginia City - Telecom Village","id":45723},"begin":"2023-08-11T21:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-05T17:39:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Since the dawn of time, humans have been driven to discover new ways of determining their location, and the location of potential threats.

Determining ownership and impact takes time and can cause critical vulnerabilities to go unnoticed, unnecessary noise, or friction between security teams and other stakeholders.\r\nMy proposed demo introduces MetaHub, a tool designed to mitigate these issues by automating the three crucial stages of security finding assessment: owner determination, contextualization, and impact definition. Leveraging the power of metadata through MetaChecks, MetaTags, MetaTrails, and MetaAccount, MetaHub provides a detailed, context-aware assessment of each finding.\r\n\r\nBy integrating MetaHub, teams can significantly reduce false positives, streamline the detection and resolution of security findings, and strategically tailor their scanner selection to minimize unnecessary noise. This ability to focus on meaningful, high-impact issues represents a significant step forward in security engineering and will be the primary focus of the demo.\r\n\r\nMetaHub relies on the ASFF format for ingesting security findings which can be consumed from AWS Security Hub or any ASFF-supported scanner, like Prowler or ElectricEye.

Determining ownership and impact takes time and can cause critical vulnerabilities to go unnoticed, unnecessary noise, or friction between security teams and other stakeholders.\r\nMy proposed demo introduces MetaHub, a tool designed to mitigate these issues by automating the three crucial stages of security finding assessment: owner determination, contextualization, and impact definition. Leveraging the power of metadata through MetaChecks, MetaTags, MetaTrails, and MetaAccount, MetaHub provides a detailed, context-aware assessment of each finding.\r\n\r\nBy integrating MetaHub, teams can significantly reduce false positives, streamline the detection and resolution of security findings, and strategically tailor their scanner selection to minimize unnecessary noise. This ability to focus on meaningful, high-impact issues represents a significant step forward in security engineering and will be the primary focus of the demo.\r\n\r\nMetaHub relies on the ASFF format for ingesting security findings which can be consumed from AWS Security Hub or any ASFF-supported scanner, like Prowler or ElectricEye. It can also help to generate reports and dashboards.\r\n\r\nMetaHub is designed for use as a CLI tool or within automated workflows, such as AWS Security Hub custom actions, AWS Lambda functions, or AWS Step Functions.\r\n\r\nContext, ownership, and impact definitions are not common topics that open source tools are addressing; this one is the approach I found for this problem that aims to be agnostic to the source scanner itself.

However, this data is already being used in investigating other criminalized activities. In this talk, we will show you examples of information that can easily be extracted from many phones to surveil personal reproductive decisions.\r\n\r\nWe will also show you how the government obtains your not-so-private thoughts using forensic extraction and reporting tools, with a focus on health and lifestyle apps. This will include a review of the output of common forensic tools, demonstrating both the practical ease of reviewing sensitive data and the technical limitations of interpreting their meaning. Warning: you may find this peek into digital investigations disturbing.\r\n\r\nWe will discuss the different laws that do, or do not, protect your private health data, but will focus primarily on the limitations of the 4th Amendment in the digital world. The talk will provide a brief overview of traditional warrant practice and the \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" in digital data. But because the law has no bearing on reality, we'll look at excerpts from search warrants for digital devices and cloud data that illustrate the flawed nature of warrant practice in general, the limitations of the practice in the digital context, and the ease with which the government can obtain your data without any real oversight.\r\n\r\nBibliography & References:\r\n - United States v.

However, this data is already being used in investigating other criminalized activities. In this talk, we will show you examples of information that can easily be extracted from many phones to surveil personal reproductive decisions.\r\n\r\nWe will also show you how the government obtains your not-so-private thoughts using forensic extraction and reporting tools, with a focus on health and lifestyle apps. This will include a review of the output of common forensic tools, demonstrating both the practical ease of reviewing sensitive data and the technical limitations of interpreting their meaning.

Exploiting either of these bugs, we managed to serve a victim an arbitrary stream by tunneling their connection with the camera into an attacker-controlled server while leaving all other camera features operational. \r\n\r\nWe will take a deep dive into the whole research process: firmware analysis, vulnerability discovery, building a toolchain to compile a debugger for the target, developing an exploit capable of bypassing ASLR, and all the details about the Hollywood-style post-exploitation including tracing, in memory code patching and manipulating the execution of the binary that implements most of the camera features. \r\n\r\nBy filling the gap between IoT hacking and the big screen, we put the integrity of video surveillance systems into question and hope to raise awareness about the security risks posed by these devices.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691079600,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[52143],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52368],"name":"Octavio Gianatiempo","affiliations":[{"organization":"Faraday","title":"Security Researcher"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51398,"title":"Security Researcher at Faraday"},{"content_ids":[52143],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52368],"name":"Javier Aguinaga","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51399}],"timeband_id":990,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-11T20:50:00.000-0000","id":52368,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[40287,45645,45646,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691784000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":51399},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":4,"person_id":51398}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45692,"name":"Caesars Forum - Alliance - 311-312 - Hardware/Soldering Vlgs","hotel":"","short_name":"Alliance - 311-312 - Hardware/Soldering Vlgs","id":45868},"begin":"2023-08-11T20:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-03T16:20:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Find a security vulnerability in an app and get a score when you effectively fix it.

This fireside chat explores how the government is facilitating progress toward foundational supply chain security (including open source software security, AI security, and software security by design), highlights the next iteration of its approach to long-term resilience, and outlines opportunities for individuals and organizations to partner in these efforts.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1690475940,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[51502,51506],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51658,51662],"name":"Camille Stewart Gloster","affiliations":[{"organization":"Technology and Ecosystem Security Division, Office of the National Cyber Director","title":"Deputy National Cyber Director"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50585,"title":"Deputy National Cyber Director at Technology and Ecosystem Security Division, Office of the National Cyber Director"},{"content_ids":[51506],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51662],"name":"Eric Goldstein","affiliations":[{"organization":"Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)","title":"Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50601,"title":"Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity at Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)"}],"timeband_id":990,"end":"2023-08-11T20:50:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Feedback","type":"link","url":"https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3eGdwIOCKgfEozY"}],"id":51662,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[40310,45645,45646,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691784000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":50585},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":4,"person_id":50601}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45719,"name":"Caesars Forum - Summit - 218-219 - Policy Rotunda","hotel":"","short_name":"Summit - 218-219 - Policy Rotunda","id":45824},"begin":"2023-08-11T20:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-07-27T16:39:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"","title":"What 10 years of drive stats data can tell us","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-07-15T16:40+0000","color":"#d86e9f","name":"Village Talk","id":45645},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691791200,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1690417860,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[51462],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51618],"name":"Andy Klein","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50516}],"timeband_id":990,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-11T22:00:00.000-0000","id":51618,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[40285,45645,45646,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691784000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":50516}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45719,"name":"Caesars Forum - Summit - 232-233 - Shared Stage","hotel":"","short_name":"Summit - 232-233 - Shared Stage","id":45900},"begin":"2023-08-11T20:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-07-27T00:31:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"","title":"No Starch Press - Book Signing - Craig Smith, The Car Hacker's Handbook","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-07-15T16:40+0000","color":"#2ec300","name":"Vendor Event","id":45769},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691787600,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1690416180,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"timeband_id":990,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-11T21:00:00.000-0000","id":51605,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45646,45743,45769,45770],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691784000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45692,"name":"Caesars Forum - Alliance - 305-306 - Vendors","hotel":"","short_name":"Alliance - 305-306 - Vendors","id":45866},"begin":"2023-08-11T20:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-07-27T00:03:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Take the test to join what has been considered to be one of the first hacker communities, amateur radio!

As AI develops at a rapid rate, open-source software (OSS) platforms develop alongside it. Hugging Face is one of these prevailing OSS platforms as it hosts pre-trained AI models, facilitating the accessibility of AI models. Hugging Face is used by over 22,000 organizations, including Intel and Microsoft, has supported more than 2.6 billion model downloads, and is rapidly growing. Just in the past year, Hugging Face has more than doubled its model library from 80,000 models to 203,000 models. However, while Hugging Face democratizes access to AI models, these models may contain unknown security vulnerabilities. Our research focuses on automating our collection process of Hugging Face models, linking them to their primary codebases on GitHub, and executing a large-scale vulnerability assessment of these GitHub repositories using static scanners. We collected more than 110,000 Hugging Face models and over 29,000 GitHub repositories. Our vulnerability assessment of these GitHub models depicted that 35.98% of the severities detected from the root GitHub repositories (developed by Hugging Face) were high-severity vulnerabilities while only 6.79% were low-severity. On the other hand, 82.89% of vulnerabilities from searched repositories (determined through the ‘huggingface’ keyword) are low-severity and 7.49% high-severity, while 82.69% of vulnerabilities from the repositories forked from the root repositories were low-severity and 9.22% were high-severity. The trend in severity levels found in root repositories contradicts the results of severities detected in forked and searched repositories. Given that many of the vulnerabilities reside in fundamental AI repositories such as Transformers, this vulnerability assessment has significant implications for supply chain software security and AI risk management more broadly.\n\n\n","title":"Assessing the Vulnerabilities of the Open-Source Artificial Intelligence (AI) Landscape: A Large-Scale Analysis of the Hugging Face Platform","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-07-15T16:40+0000","color":"#d86e9f","name":"Village Talk","id":45645},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691781900,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has earned its title as one of the most critical disruptive technologies in the 21st century.

For each discovered vulnerability, we step through the attack requirements, access vector, and attack workflow in order to help developers and bug hunters identify common software flaws going forward.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nhttps://support.zte.com.cn/support/news/LoopholeInfoDetail.aspx?newsId=1030664\r\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oneplus-phones-come-preinstalled-with-a-factory-app-that-can-root-devices/\r\nhttps://source.android.com/docs/security/features/selinux#background\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem\r\nhttps://github.com/thanuj10/Nokia-Debloater\r\nhttps://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids#best-practices-android-identifiers\r\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/hardware/ril/+/master/include/telephony/ril.h\r\nhttps://github.com/lbule/android_hardware_mediatek\r\nhttps://security.tecno.com/SRC/blogdetail/99?lang=en_US\r\nhttps://extensionpublications.unl.edu/assets/pdf/ec157.pdf\r\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/java/android/service/persistentdata/PersistentDataBlockManager.java#143\r\nhttps://github.com/ptoomey3/evilarc/blob/master/evilarc.py\r\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/packages/SystemUI/\r\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Settings/+/refs/heads/master","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1688182980,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[50668],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50797],"name":"Ryan Johnson","affiliations":[{"organization":"Quokka","title":"Senior Director, R&D"}],"links":[],"pronouns":"he/him","media":[],"id":49964,"title":"Senior Director, R&D at Quokka"},{"content_ids":[50668],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50797],"name":"Angelos Stavrou","affiliations":[{"organization":"Quokka","title":"Founder and Chief Scientist"}],"links":[],"pronouns":"he/him","media":[],"id":49965,"title":"Founder and Chief Scientist at Quokka"},{"content_ids":[50668],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50797],"name":"Mohamed Elsabagh","affiliations":[{"organization":"Quokka","title":"Senior Director, R&D"}],"links":[],"pronouns":"he/him","media":[],"id":49966,"title":"Senior Director, R&D at Quokka"}],"timeband_id":990,"end":"2023-08-11T19:45:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/246121"},{"label":"Quokka","type":"link","url":"https://www.quokka.io"}],"id":50797,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45589,45592,45629,45646,45766],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691780400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Exploit 🪲, Demo 💻","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":49965},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":4,"person_id":49966},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":6,"person_id":49964}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45655,"name":"Caesars Forum - Forum - 109-119, 138-139 - Track 2","hotel":"","short_name":"Forum - 109-119, 138-139 - Track 2","id":45797},"begin":"2023-08-11T19:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-07-01T03:43:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Harri Hursti will be doing an unboxing of sometthing very high profile.\n\n\n","title":"Surprise Unboxing","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-07-15T16:40+0000","color":"#60b0ba","name":"Village Activity","id":45775},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691781600,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Harri Hursti will be doing an unboxing of sometthing very high profile.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691435460,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[52313,52327,52331,52337],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52597,52611,52615,52621,52622],"name":"Harri Hursti","affiliations":[],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hhursti"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@harrihursti)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/harrihursti"},{"description":"","title":"Village Website","sort_order":0,"url":"https://votingvillage.org"}],"media":[],"id":51542}],"timeband_id":990,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-11T19:20:00.000-0000","id":52611,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[40298,45646,45743,45775],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691779500,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":2,"person_id":51542}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":45694,"name":"Caesars Forum - Academy - 415-418 - Voting Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Academy - 415-418 - Voting Village","id":45872},"begin":"2023-08-11T18:45:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-07T19:11:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Exposed secrets like API keys and other credentials continue to be a persistent vulnerability.

It also speaks to physical security. The term “hack” is to be interpreted broadly, sometimes referring to specific techniques (such as LDAP injection), broader hack categories (such as Man in the Middle) and other times referring to broad strategic approaches that facilitate specific hacks (such as social engineering). The paper is designed to paint a picture of the threat landscape, rather than serve as a technical guide. The paper is written at a basic technical level to keep it as accessible as possible to non-technical readers, as many of those participating in Voting Village are uniquely non-techie within the DEF CON setting. It starts early from a more technical perspective before becoming more accessible and eventually policy-focused. The objective is to promote best security practices and provide organizational administrators (as opposed to technical administrators) context for the types of challenges that exist. As such, it attempts to walk a tricky line to be accessible to as many as possible. It is presented in a casual “top ten” format and touches on a broad range of hacks are discussed very briefly. The paper should not be considered a tool for security professionals to gain a comprehensive understanding of each hack on the list. Its purpose is to educate generally, help point security admins in the right direction, and encourage them to dig deeper than the ankle-deep information provided.

Malicious JScript Composite Action is a developed custom action that performs an attack using JScript, after replacing the script engine from node.exe to wscript.exe through Binary Hijacking and Masquerading. Malicious JavaScript Custom Action performs the attack from Nodejs implemented using its C++ addons.\r\n - GitHub Actions C2 - We will demonstrate a new C2 framework using self-hosted runner in GitHub Actions.

To study RDP attacks, we created PyRDP, an open-source RDP interception tool with unmatched capabilities which helped us collect more than 100 hours of video footage of attackers in action.\r\n\r\nTo describe attackers’ behaviors, we characterized the various archetypes of threat actors in groups based on their traits through a Dungeon & Dragons analogy: 1) the Bards making obtuse search or watch unholy videos; 2) the Rangers stealthily explore computers and perform reconnaissance; 3) the Thieves try to monetize the RDP access; 4)the Barbarians use a large array of tools to brute-force their way into more computers; and 5) the Wizardsuse their RDP access as a magic portal to cloak their origins.

Breathless claims were made about deep learning replacing signatures, revolutionizing zero-day attack detection, threat intelligence, and predicting the future.  A decade later we can say that it didn’t.  ML found a few applications as a value-add (e.g. as a complement to signatures in malware detection), but never became load bearing.

Breathless claims were made about deep learning replacing signatures, revolutionizing zero-day attack detection, threat intelligence, and predicting the future.  A decade later we can say that it didn’t.  ML found a few applications as a value-add (e.g. as a complement to signatures in malware detection), but never became load bearing.  Instead, our field continued to improve its basic technologies – signatures, databases, event processing pipelines, and, most importantly, manual human processes.

The objective of the Red Team CTF is for teams to successfully breach the security of a simulated target network.\r\n \r\n The Red Team CTF is designed to simulate real-world scenarios in which attackers attempt to penetrate the security of a network or system.

This is a game that pits you against threat actors in the near future, who are trying to trigger nuclear war! Using cyber threat intelligence, it is up to you to support cyber protection teams to defend a vital satellite constellation and prevent a hacker network from undermining your collective defense in a race against time.\r\n\r\nDescription of the event\r\nThe event will host three simultaneous instances of a team game. Teams consist of three players each. Nine players can play at a time. We will provide three laptops and displays, along with three facilitators to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience. Each game is 20 minutes duration, allowing up to 300 players to play the game in-person on the day.\r\nWe have successfully delivered similar games to large groups of participants in the past, and we are confident that this event will add to the success of DEF CON 31.\r\n\r\nDescription of the game\r\nCyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) deals with information from past attacks, malware analysis and evolving threats in cyberspace. CTI enables enhanced decisions and to get ahead of the cyber attack. But how can I apply CTI and use it? The game \"IntelOps - Operation Spacewatch\" aims to improve players' understanding of CTI. Participants learn about different frameworks, sources and types of CTI and how they can use CTI data in a fun way. The game is built to not only teach terms and theory but apply CTI in a real-world context.\r\nThe game is based on four major CTI and cyber security models. These are the NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF), MITRE ATT&CK Matrix, the Cyber Kill Chain and the Pyramid of Pain. \r\nAs a player, you are part of the United Nations (UN) CTI team and assigned to the mission to stop the attack on the satellite constellation. Your task is to use the available CTI your team has collected and assist the other members of the UN Cyber Protection Team (CPT).\r\nThe players find themselves in a near future scenario where every nation has access to ballistic-launched nuclear weapons. For monitoring and control purposes, the United Nations has established a global satellite defense system to detect ballistic and hypersonic missile launches. The defense system allows the UN to be able to react immediately when suspicious activities on the weapons are detected.

The number of cards and information as well as the number of packages that can be sent to the satellites are limited. The CTI cards must be applied to each NIST CSF phase. Each phase of the NIST CSF has limited fields for applying the CTI information. The limitation is based on the limited number of packets that can be sent to the satellite network. The game includes four turns in total to save the satellite network. Depending on the effectiveness of the CTI application, there is a chance to stop the attack at every turn. The status of the cyber attack and the effectiveness of the applied CTI information is presented with the help of the Cyber Kill Chain. It represents the attacker's view. If the chosen CTI strategy and application were not successful, the team loses a satellite to the hacker network. In this case, the colour of a satellite on the monitor changes from red to green.\r\n\r\nGame duration\r\nEvery game last 20 minutes in total. Each turn, the players have 5 minutes to decide on their CTI strategy, apply the information to the NIST CSF board and stop the attack.

This is a game that pits you against threat actors in the near future, who are trying to trigger nuclear war! Using cyber threat intelligence, it is up to you to support cyber protection teams to defend a vital satellite constellation and prevent a hacker network from undermining your collective defense in a race against time.\r\n\r\nDescription of the event\r\nThe event will host three simultaneous instances of a team game. Teams consist of three players each. Nine players can play at a time. We will provide three laptops and displays, along with three facilitators to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience. Each game is 20 minutes duration, allowing up to 300 players to play the game in-person on the day.\r\nWe have successfully delivered similar games to large groups of participants in the past, and we are confident that this event will add to the success of DEF CON 31.\r\n\r\nDescription of the game\r\nCyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) deals with information from past attacks, malware analysis and evolving threats in cyberspace. CTI enables enhanced decisions and to get ahead of the cyber attack. But how can I apply CTI and use it? The game \"IntelOps - Operation Spacewatch\" aims to improve players' understanding of CTI. Participants learn about different frameworks, sources and types of CTI and how they can use CTI data in a fun way. The game is built to not only teach terms and theory but apply CTI in a real-world context.\r\nThe game is based on four major CTI and cyber security models. These are the NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF), MITRE ATT&CK Matrix, the Cyber Kill Chain and the Pyramid of Pain. \r\nAs a player, you are part of the United Nations (UN) CTI team and assigned to the mission to stop the attack on the satellite constellation. Your task is to use the available CTI your team has collected and assist the other members of the UN Cyber Protection Team (CPT).\r\nThe players find themselves in a near future scenario where every nation has access to ballistic-launched nuclear weapons. For monitoring and control purposes, the United Nations has established a global satellite defense system to detect ballistic and hypersonic missile launches. The defense system allows the UN to be able to react immediately when suspicious activities on the weapons are detected. A global hacker network is threatening to disable the satellite constellation to use nuclear weapons for their purposes.\r\nThere are 32 satellites in the global defense system your team has to protect. If 4 or more satellites are compromised and deactivated, the hacker network successfully disenabled the defense system and can take control of the nuclear weapons. It is your mission to protect the satellite network and ensure the availability of the global defense system.\r\n\r\nThe players are provided with the following game components:\r\n- CTI information in form of a card deck;\r\n- An overview of the satellite network and the satellite’s availability status;\r\n- The status and progress of the cyber attackpresented with the Cyber Kill Chain;\r\n- The Pyramid of Pain to allocate and classify the CTI data;\r\n- A NIST CSF game board to place and apply the CTI information;\r\n- Scenario description.\r\n\r\nWhile the CTI cards and the NIST CSF game board are provided as physical components, the Cyber Kill Chain, the satellite network and the Pyramid of Pain will be displayed on a monitor managed through a laptop by the game facilitators.\r\n\r\nSummary of gameplay\r\nThe CTI cards must be played strategically to stop the cyber attack.

This unique competition is designed to replicate enterprise infrastructure and present participants with challenges that encourage the adoption of various techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) employed by real adversaries and threat actors, all within a defined time frame.\r\n\r\nAdversary Village is a community-driven initiative that prioritizes adversary simulation, emulation, breach and attack simulation, adversary tactics, offensive/adversary tradecraft, philosophy, and purple teaming.\r\n\r\nOur objective is to establish a Capture the Flag competition dedicated to adversary simulation, purple teaming and knowledge sharing. Adversary Wars offers unique opportunities for “adversaries” aka participants to simulate attacks, explore new attack vectors, gain insights into threat actor profiles, master TTPs, and refine offensive tradecraft.

In response, Strix is a security testing UAV designed to intercept other UAVs in flight while adhering to legal limitations. It utilizes software analysis to detect and track unauthorized UAVs, predicting their flight path without compromising itself. Strix also encompasses ground-based support systems for enhanced mission effectiveness. The ground-based robots and drones can perform tasks such as reconnaissance, target identification, and data analysis to enhance the effectiveness of Strix's mission.The drone can detect RF anti-drone systems and, if identified, utilize multi-RF spoofing technology to disrupt or block their signals. This allows Strix to enter protected airspace undetected, while staying within legal bounds when required. Strix was designed to identify other UAVs and attempt to jam or possibly control their signals to their flight operators. Its hardware includes sensors, a robust communication system, and the Pixhawk autonomous flight module, which provides open-source flexibility and customization options.Strix's small and agile design enables high-speed flight and maneuverability in confined spaces. Advanced encryption ensures data security during collection and transmission. As an open-source project, Strix encourages customization and collaboration, making it an invaluable tool for securing airspace and mitigating UAV threats.

In response, Strix is a security testing UAV designed to intercept other UAVs in flight while adhering to legal limitations. It utilizes software analysis to detect and track unauthorized UAVs, predicting their flight path without compromising itself. Strix also encompasses ground-based support systems for enhanced mission effectiveness. The ground-based robots and drones can perform tasks such as reconnaissance, target identification, and data analysis to enhance the effectiveness of Strix's mission.The drone can detect RF anti-drone systems and, if identified, utilize multi-RF spoofing technology to disrupt or block their signals. This allows Strix to enter protected airspace undetected, while staying within legal bounds when required. Strix was designed to identify other UAVs and attempt to jam or possibly control their signals to their flight operators. Its hardware includes sensors, a robust communication system, and the Pixhawk autonomous flight module, which provides open-source flexibility and customization options.Strix's small and agile design enables high-speed flight and maneuverability in confined spaces. Advanced encryption ensures data security during collection and transmission. As an open-source project, Strix encourages customization and collaboration, making it an invaluable tool for securing airspace and mitigating UAV threats.

Whether you’re an attacker, defender, business executive, or brand new to this community, you can learn by witnessing firsthand how easy it is for some competitors to schmooze their way to their goals and how well prepared some companies are to shut down those competitors! \r\n\r\n2023 judges: Corgi, FC aka freakyclown, and Snow\r\n2023 coaches: Ibetika, JC, C_3PJoe, and Split Beans (last year's SECVC winners: Jenn, Matt, and Sean)\r\n\r\nThis competition takes place on Friday in the Social Engineering Community village, be sure to get there early to get a seat; they fill up fast!

With DotNet malware being used by APT actors and script kiddies, and anything in-between, it is safe to say that one will encounter it sooner rather than later. This four-hour workshop primarily focuses on the analyst mindset and fundamental knowledge, including topics such as loaders, unpacking, obfuscation, DotNet internals, and (un)managed hooks. In short, one will learn how to analyse DotNet malware, and write automatic unpackers. As such, this class is perfect for aspiring and beginning analysts, while also providing background information and additional techniques for intermediate analysts.\r\n\r\nThe workshop’s materials will partially consist of actual malware samples, the precautions for which will be explained in-detail during the workshop, ensuring the safety and integrity of the systems of the attendees.

With DotNet malware being used by APT actors and script kiddies, and anything in-between, it is safe to say that one will encounter it sooner rather than later. This four-hour workshop primarily focuses on the analyst mindset and fundamental knowledge, including topics such as loaders, unpacking, obfuscation, DotNet internals, and (un)managed hooks. In short, one will learn how to analyse DotNet malware, and write automatic unpackers. As such, this class is perfect for aspiring and beginning analysts, while also providing background information and additional techniques for intermediate analysts.\r\n\r\nThe workshop’s materials will partially consist of actual malware samples, the precautions for which will be explained in-detail during the workshop, ensuring the safety and integrity of the systems of the attendees.

Many new attack vectors create known and unknown attack vectors, generating a considerable need for further research and detection in this field.\r\n\r\nIn the current cloud security world, access keys are the new perimeter, and permissions associated with those keys are the limits. In many real-world scenarios, leaked access keys are the initial vectors to get into an organization's cloud environments.
