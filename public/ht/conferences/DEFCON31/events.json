Recently, mobile payment solutions have become increasingly popular, allowing passengers to pay for their fare using their smartphones or other mobile devices.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of public transportation payment systems has been driven by the need for faster, more convenient, and more secure payment methods, and this trend is likely to continue in the years to come, But how secure are mobile payment solutions for public transportation?\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will examine the security risks associated with transportation applications, using Moovit as a case study. Moovit is a widely used transportation app operating in over 100 countries and 5000+ cities. Through our investigation of the app's API, including SSL-encrypted data, we discovered specific vulnerabilities, which we will discuss.

Recently, mobile payment solutions have become increasingly popular, allowing passengers to pay for their fare using their smartphones or other mobile devices.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of public transportation payment systems has been driven by the need for faster, more convenient, and more secure payment methods, and this trend is likely to continue in the years to come, But how secure are mobile payment solutions for public transportation?\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will examine the security risks associated with transportation applications, using Moovit as a case study. Moovit is a widely used transportation app operating in over 100 countries and 5000+ cities. Through our investigation of the app's API, including SSL-encrypted data, we discovered specific vulnerabilities, which we will discuss. We will also demonstrate a custom user interface that can obtain a \"free ticket\" and cause someone else to pay. Furthermore, we will explain how an attacker could gain unauthorized access to and exfiltrate Personal Identifiable Information (PII) of registered users. Our findings offer practical recommendations to improve the security of transportation apps.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\nhttps://github.com/httptoolkit/frida-android-unpinning/blob/main/frida-script.js\r\nhttps://moovit.com/","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691959500,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1688183400,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[50566,50672],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50824,50834],"name":"Omer Attias","affiliations":[{"organization":"SafeBreach Labs","title":"Security Researcher"}],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/omer-attias-209a9a127/"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/@omerat21"}],"media":[],"id":49782,"title":"Security Researcher at SafeBreach Labs"}],"timeband_id":992,"end":"2023-08-13T20:45:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/246125"}],"id":50824,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691956800,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[45589,45592,45630,45646,45766],"village_id":null,"includes":"Tool 🛠, Demo 💻","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49782}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45655,"name":"Caesars Forum - Forum - 130-134 - Track 3","hotel":"","short_name":"Forum - 130-134 - Track 3","id":45798},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2023-08-13T20:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-07-01T03:50:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":".\n\n\nBlue Team Village Closing Ceremony","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","color":"#d86e9f","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","name":"Village Talk","id":45645},"title":"Blue Team Village Closing Ceremony","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691959500,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":".\n\n\nBlue Team Village Closing Ceremony","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691247540,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"timeband_id":992,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-13T20:45:00.000-0000","id":52478,"tag_ids":[40282,45645,45647,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691955900,"nanoseconds":0},"village_id":null,"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45645,"name":"Flamingo - Sunset - Scenic - Blue Team Village - Main Stage","hotel":"","short_name":"BTV Main Stage","id":45969},"begin":"2023-08-13T19:45:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-05T14:59:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"CNAPPGoat is a CLI tool designed to deploy intentionally vulnerable-by-design cloud infrastructure.

Therefore, we need to leverage a security pipeline approach for well defined structure and automation.. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will cover:\r\n- creating a structure for these reviews based on their scope and priority\r\n- calibrating reviews as a team and organization\r\n- leveraging partnerships like security champions (engineers) as key players who are not responsible for the pipeline but help move the pipeline further\r\n- capturing key risk and remediation metrics\r\n- building automation and tooling centered around for threat modeling in a complete security assessment","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691076540,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[52132],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52352],"name":"Larkins Carvalho","affiliations":[],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":null,"title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://linkedin.com/in/larkinscarvalho"},{"description":null,"title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/larkinscarvalho"}],"media":[],"id":51358},{"content_ids":[52132],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52352],"name":"Nielet D'mello","affiliations":[],"links":[{"description":null,"title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nieletdmello/"}],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51367}],"timeband_id":992,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-13T18:45:00.000-0000","id":52352,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[40297,45645,45647,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691949600,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":51358},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":51367}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45712,"name":"Flamingo - Savoy - AppSec Village - Main Stage","hotel":"","short_name":"AppSec Village - Main Stage","id":45960},"begin":"2023-08-13T18:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-03T15:29:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Come down to the Policy track on Sunday morning and test your knowledge of all the most trivial aspects of tech policy!

An organisation's security perimeter has become blurred, with resources increasingly exposed, making it harder to clearly establish their attack surface. Components of network and security controls have been abstracted away, including the specific on how they are implemented. One of these abstractions is through Azure Service Tags, a feature that we frequently see being used, and one that often results in resources being more exposed than intended.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will explore Service Tags in Azure, a common method for modern organisations to use pre-defined network ranges to be allow-listed for inbound and outbound network traffic. Although a useful means to simplify configuration to allow service-to-service communication, its usage can lead to unintentional cross-tenant access to Azure resources. The aim of the talk is to highlight several novel methods by which attackers can get access to a corporate environment. These will range from:\r\n\r\n - Accessing internal resources via an attacker controlled VM in a different tenant\r\n - Abusing Azure Logic Apps functionality to interact with internal APIs\r\n - Using SaaS services such as Azure DevOps to modify pipelines within a misconfigured target organisation\r\n\r\nFundamentally, this is the service working as intended. Service Tags are *supposed* to cover Azure service network ranges and these *do*, by design, include other organisations' environments. The issue mostly lies in the lack of detailed documentation and the lack of awareness around the breadth of coverage, and the potential impact of these controls.

An organisation's security perimeter has become blurred, with resources increasingly exposed, making it harder to clearly establish their attack surface. Components of network and security controls have been abstracted away, including the specific on how they are implemented. One of these abstractions is through Azure Service Tags, a feature that we frequently see being used, and one that often results in resources being more exposed than intended.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will explore Service Tags in Azure, a common method for modern organisations to use pre-defined network ranges to be allow-listed for inbound and outbound network traffic. Although a useful means to simplify configuration to allow service-to-service communication, its usage can lead to unintentional cross-tenant access to Azure resources. The aim of the talk is to highlight several novel methods by which attackers can get access to a corporate environment. These will range from:\r\n\r\n - Accessing internal resources via an attacker controlled VM in a different tenant\r\n - Abusing Azure Logic Apps functionality to interact with internal APIs\r\n - Using SaaS services such as Azure DevOps to modify pipelines within a misconfigured target organisation\r\n\r\nFundamentally, this is the service working as intended. Service Tags are *supposed* to cover Azure service network ranges and these *do*, by design, include other organisations' environments. The issue mostly lies in the lack of detailed documentation and the lack of awareness around the breadth of coverage, and the potential impact of these controls. Where documentation is available that highlights some of these components, it is inconsistent in outlining the risks and potential impact. Through our work at a consultancy, we have worked with a range of organisations from large enterprises to medium sized companies.

You are welcome to print your own copy of the receipt, if you need a receipt. Printed receipts are not available at the time of purchase.\r\n - Please help us make this a great experience for everyone: **follow directions given by goons** and get in the correct line. Note that there may be one line for all of registration, or there may be two lines (pre-registration vs cash) -- this may change over time, based on available staffing and necessary crowd control.\r\n - Please be patient. The time listed here for the beginning of registration is approximate. We will begin processing the line on Thursday morning as soon as the cashiers and materials are in place; this may be earlier or later than the scheduled time.\r\n - There are no refunds given for cash sales. If you have any doubt, do not buy the badge.\r\n - If you have questions about anything regarding registration, that are not addressed here, please ask to speak to a Registration Goon.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691960400,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691559000,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"timeband_id":992,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-13T21:00:00.000-0000","id":51698,"tag_ids":[45640,45646,45743],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691946000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45655,"name":"Caesars Forum - Forum - 101-103 - Reg","hotel":"","short_name":"Forum - 101-103 - Reg","id":45853},"spans_timebands":"N","updated":"2023-08-09T05:30:00.000-0000","begin":"2023-08-13T17:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"This is your last chance to pickup your drives whether they're finished or not.

If you play virtual only, consider the game an opportunity to learn, practice, hone your skills, and still get on the scoreboard for bragging rights.

Exploit as many as you can during the con and the top three teams will be rewarded.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691960400,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1690061880,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"timeband_id":992,"end":"2023-08-13T21:00:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/245348"},{"label":"Discord","type":"link","url":"https://discord.com/channels/708208267699945503/711644307597164665"},{"label":"Scoreboard","type":"link","url":"https://scoreboard.iotvillage.org/"}],"id":51491,"village_id":66,"tag_ids":[45635,45646,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691946000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45692,"name":"Caesars Forum - Alliance - 307-310 - IOT Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Alliance - 307-310 - IOT Village","id":45867},"updated":"2023-07-22T21:38:00.000-0000","begin":"2023-08-13T17:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"In the world of amateur radio, groups of hams will often put together a transmitter hunt (also called \"fox hunting\") in order to hone their radio direction finding skills to locate one or more hidden radio transmitters broadcasting.

We plan to use this event to keep drawing attention to the automotive security industry through hands-on challenges.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1690055760,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"timeband_id":992,"links":[{"label":"Discord","type":"link","url":"https://discord.com/channels/708208267699945503/711643596658311229"},{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/244786"},{"label":"Twitter (@CarHackVillage)","type":"link","url":"https://twitter.com/CarHackVillage/"},{"label":"Village Website","type":"link","url":"https://www.carhackingvillage.com"}],"end":"2023-08-13T19:00:00.000-0000","id":51442,"tag_ids":[45635,45646,45743],"village_id":42,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691946000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45719,"name":"Caesars Forum - Summit - Contest Area","hotel":"","short_name":"Summit - Contest Area","id":45855},"updated":"2023-07-22T19:56:00.000-0000","begin":"2023-08-13T17:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Battle of The Bots presents a new twist on traditional “King-of-The-Hill” style Capture the Flag events by incorporating exploit development, vulnerability analysis, reverse engineering and software development in the form of developing computer worms aka “bots”.

When is it?\r\n\r\nChatGPT: Yes, Hacker Jeopardy is a popular event at DEF CON. It's a parody of the television game show \"Jeopardy!\" but with a twist. Instead of general knowledge, the questions (or \"answers,\" in Jeopardy style) are focused on hacker culture, computer security, technology, and similar topics. The game consists of two preliminary rounds on Friday, and a final round on Saturday. Both shows start at 2000 Las Vegas time. Just like in the original game show, there are DFIU Doubles and a Final Hacker Jeopardy round. One unique aspect of Hacker Jeopardy that distinguishes it from the TV show is the incorporation of ADULT HUMOR, vulgarity, innuendo, and beer into the game. Please remember, my knowledge is current only up to September 2021, and if there have been any significant changes to Hacker Jeopardy after that, I would not be aware of them.\r\n\r\nLintile: What's the catch phrase of Hacker Jeopardy?\r\n\r\nChatGPT: The catch phrase of Hacker Jeopardy is \"Drink while you think\". This refers to the unique element of the game where contestants are encouraged to drink beer while they are attempting to come up with the correct response to the clues.\r\n\r\nLintile: That's not correct. The acronym of the catch phrase is DFIU.\r\n\r\nChatGPT: I apologize for the oversight. The catchphrase for Hacker Jeopardy at DEF CON is \"Don't Forget It's UNIX\" (DFIU), which is used humorously due to the historically significant role of Unix-based systems in hacking and network security. This phrase is often used to remind participants of the roots of many computer systems and infrastructures. I appreciate your patience and your correct information.\r\n\r\nNote that this is an ADULT show with vulgarities and alcohol consumption, but if that doesn’t bother you, come enjoy one of the largest contests at DEF CON that you really need to see to believe!

Instead of general knowledge, the questions (or \"answers,\" in Jeopardy style) are focused on hacker culture, computer security, technology, and similar topics. The game consists of two preliminary rounds on Friday, and a final round on Saturday. Both shows start at 2000 Las Vegas time. Just like in the original game show, there are DFIU Doubles and a Final Hacker Jeopardy round. One unique aspect of Hacker Jeopardy that distinguishes it from the TV show is the incorporation of ADULT HUMOR, vulgarity, innuendo, and beer into the game. Please remember, my knowledge is current only up to September 2021, and if there have been any significant changes to Hacker Jeopardy after that, I would not be aware of them.\r\n\r\nLintile: What's the catch phrase of Hacker Jeopardy?\r\n\r\nChatGPT: The catch phrase of Hacker Jeopardy is \"Drink while you think\". This refers to the unique element of the game where contestants are encouraged to drink beer while they are attempting to come up with the correct response to the clues.\r\n\r\nLintile: That's not correct. The acronym of the catch phrase is DFIU.\r\n\r\nChatGPT: I apologize for the oversight. The catchphrase for Hacker Jeopardy at DEF CON is \"Don't Forget It's UNIX\" (DFIU), which is used humorously due to the historically significant role of Unix-based systems in hacking and network security. This phrase is often used to remind participants of the roots of many computer systems and infrastructures. I appreciate your patience and your correct information.\r\n\r\nNote that this is an ADULT show with vulgarities and alcohol consumption, but if that doesn’t bother you, come enjoy one of the largest contests at DEF CON that you really need to see to believe! And as always, DFIU!","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1690124100,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"timeband_id":991,"end":"2023-08-13T05:00:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/245321"}],"id":51477,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45635,45646,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691895600,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45655,"name":"Caesars Forum - Forum - 105,135,136 - Track 1","hotel":"","short_name":"Forum - 105,135,136 - Track 1","id":45796},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2023-08-13T03:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-07-23T14:55:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Party with other DEF CON kids.

It will build on and update a discussion held last year, also led by EFF and DDF.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\nhttps://www.eff.org/issues/reproductive-rights\r\nhttps://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/03/texas-bill-would-systematically-silence-anyone-who-dares-talk-about-abortion-pills\r\nhttps://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/02/eff-backs-california-bill-protect-people-seeking-abortion-and-gender-affirming\r\nhttps://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/09/automated-license-plate-readers-threaten-abortion-access-heres-how-policymakers\r\nhttps://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/08/nonprofit-websites-are-full-of-trackers-that-should-change\r\nhttps://www.ifwhenhow.org/resources/self-care-criminalized-preliminary-findings/","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691885700,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1690041960,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[50639,50661],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50819,50822],"name":"Corynne McSherry","affiliations":[{"organization":"Electronic Frontier Foundation","title":"Legal Director"}],"pronouns":"she/her","links":[{"description":"","title":"About","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.eff.org/about/staff/corynne-mcsherry"},{"description":"","title":"Mastodon (@cmcsherr@sfba.social)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://sfba.social/@cmcsherr"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/cmcsherr"}],"media":[],"id":49908,"title":"Legal Director at Electronic Frontier Foundation"},{"content_ids":[50661],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50822],"name":"Kate Bertash","affiliations":[{"organization":"Digital Defense Fund","title":"Founder"}],"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/@katerosebee"}],"pronouns":"she/her","media":[],"id":49952,"title":"Founder at Digital Defense Fund"},{"content_ids":[50661],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50822],"name":"Daly Barnett","affiliations":[{"organization":"Electronic Frontier Foundation","title":"Staff Technologist"}],"links":[],"pronouns":"she/her","media":[],"id":49953,"title":"Staff Technologist at Electronic Frontier Foundation"},{"content_ids":[50661,51513],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50822,51669],"name":"India McKinney","affiliations":[{"organization":"Electronic Frontier Foundation","title":"Director of Federal Affairs"}],"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/@imck82"}],"pronouns":"she/her","media":[],"id":49954,"title":"Director of Federal Affairs at Electronic Frontier Foundation"}],"timeband_id":991,"end":"2023-08-13T00:15:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/246114"},{"label":"Digital Defense Fund","type":"link","url":"https://www.digitaldefensefund.org"},{"label":"EFF","type":"link","url":"https://www.eff.org"}],"id":50822,"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691883000,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[45589,45646,45766],"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49908},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49953},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49954},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49952}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45655,"name":"Caesars Forum - Forum - 130-134 - Track 3","hotel":"","short_name":"Forum - 130-134 - Track 3","id":45798},"begin":"2023-08-12T23:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-07-22T16:06:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"What can a website do?

Priority areas for the U.S. government include advancing the adoption of memory-safe programming languages, reforming CVE, understanding software prevalence, and building a software developer workforce of the future by integrating security into computer science curricula. As part of this, we need your help in getting it right. How can the government best support OSS community efforts? What should the government NOT be doing? It's all on the table, and we look to work with you to ensure a secure, sustainable, and resilient OSS future.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1690431780,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[51523],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51679],"name":"Anjana Rajan","affiliations":[{"organization":"The White House","title":"Assistant National Cyber Director for Technology Security"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50574,"title":"Assistant National Cyber Director for Technology Security at The White House"},{"content_ids":[51523],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51679],"name":"Brian Behlendorf","affiliations":[{"organization":"Open Source Security Foundation","title":""}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50582,"title":"Open Source Security Foundation"},{"content_ids":[51502,51510,51523],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51658,51666,51679],"name":"Charlie Gladstone","affiliations":[{"organization":"UK Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology","title":""}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50588,"title":"UK Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology"},{"content_ids":[51503,51523,51524],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51659,51679,51680],"name":"Jack Cable","affiliations":[{"organization":"Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)","title":"Senior Technical Advisor"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50609,"title":"Senior Technical Advisor at Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)"}],"timeband_id":991,"end":"2023-08-13T00:50:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Feedback","type":"link","url":"https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3eGdwIOCKgfEozY"}],"id":51679,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691881200,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[40310,45646,45743,45771],"village_id":null,"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":1,"person_id":50574},{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":1,"person_id":50582},{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":1,"person_id":50588},{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":1,"person_id":50609}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45719,"name":"Caesars Forum - Summit - 218-219 - Policy Rotunda","hotel":"","short_name":"Summit - 218-219 - Policy Rotunda","id":45824},"spans_timebands":"N","updated":"2023-07-27T04:23:00.000-0000","begin":"2023-08-12T23:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"2023 is a significant year for the IoT, with the Cyber Resilience Act in the EU and the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill in the UK, as well as labelling approaches in the US and Singapore.

What should voters, election officials, journalists and tech platforms be paying attention to?” The panel will address infrastructure foundations in election administration (election officials; voting technology);  foreign threats; the disinformation ecosystem; and new technologies such as generative AI.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691435580,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[52329,52334,52337],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52613,52618,52621,52622],"name":"Catherine Terranova","affiliations":[],"links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherine-terranova-8b209826a"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/catlovesvoting"},{"description":"","title":"Village Website","sort_order":0,"url":"https://votingvillage.org"}],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51533},{"content_ids":[52329,52332],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52613,52616],"name":"Hallie Stern","affiliations":[],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/halliejstern"}],"media":[],"id":51541},{"content_ids":[52329],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52613],"name":"Rebecca Scott Thein","affiliations":[],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bex-ecutor"}],"media":[],"id":51554},{"content_ids":[52329,52334],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52613,52618],"name":"Sandra Khalil","affiliations":[],"links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/khalilsandra"}],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51555},{"content_ids":[52329],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52613],"name":"Sarah Amos","affiliations":[],"links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah3amos"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/sarah3amos"}],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51556}],"timeband_id":991,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-12T23:20:00.000-0000","id":52613,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691879400,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[40298,45646,45743,45771],"village_id":null,"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":1,"person_id":51533},{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":1,"person_id":51541},{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":1,"person_id":51554},{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":1,"person_id":51555},{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":1,"person_id":51556}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45694,"name":"Caesars Forum - Academy - 415-418 - Voting Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Academy - 415-418 - Voting Village","id":45872},"begin":"2023-08-12T22:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-07T19:13:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"In April 2023, Sarah Bils was revealed to be one of the main people behind the DonbassDevushka social media \"personality\", posting pro-Russian propaganda to a variety of social media accounts since 2014.

Unfortunately, we have found that much downstream software is unable to timely fix the Chromium vulnerabilities.

Some software will attempt to enable sandbox to mitigate this problem, so we will also provide examples of how to bypass the sandbox by exploiting vulnerabilities in the software itself rather than a Chromium sandbox bug.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will discuss the reasons for the existence of the RCE window period and the lessons learned from it, hoping to help software developers improve the security of their products.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n[1] https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2022/06/2022-0-day-in-wild-exploitationso-far.html\r\n[2] https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?q=Type%3DBug-Security&can=2\r\n[3] https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/wiki/GeneralUsage\r\n[4] https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/\r\n[5] https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2027/DEF%20CON%2027%20presentations/DEFCON-27-Junyu-Zhou-and-Ce-Qin-and-Jianing-Wang-Web2Own-Attacking-Desktop-Apps-From-Web-Securitys-Perspective.pdf\r\n[6] https://i.blackhat.com/USA-22/Thursday/US-22-Purani-ElectroVolt-Pwning-Popular-Desktop-Apps.pdf\r\n[7] https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/jcef.html\r\n[8] https://medium.com/@ethicalkid/recent-burp-rce-zeroday-df39b1b24230\r\n[9] https://crbug.com/1307610\r\n[10] https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:external/selinux/libselinux/src/android/android_seapp.c\r\n[11] https://security.googleblog.com/2021/07/protecting-more-with-site-isolation.html","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1688180640,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[50654],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50821],"name":"Bohan Liu","affiliations":[{"organization":"Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab","title":"Senior Security Researcher"}],"pronouns":"he/him","links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/@P4nda20371774"}],"media":[],"id":49941,"title":"Senior Security Researcher at Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab"},{"content_ids":[50654],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50821],"name":"GuanCheng Li","affiliations":[{"organization":"Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab","title":"Senior Security Researcher"}],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/@atuml1"}],"media":[],"id":49942,"title":"Senior Security Researcher at Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab"},{"content_ids":[50654],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50821],"name":"Zheng Wang","affiliations":[{"organization":"Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab","title":"Senior Security Researcher"}],"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/@xmzyshypnc"}],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":49943,"title":"Senior Security Researcher at Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab"}],"timeband_id":991,"end":"2023-08-12T23:15:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/246107"}],"id":50821,"tag_ids":[45589,45592,45629,45646,45766],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691879400,"nanoseconds":0},"village_id":null,"includes":"Exploit 🪲, Demo 💻","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49941},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49942},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49943}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45655,"name":"Caesars Forum - Forum - 130-134 - Track 3","hotel":"","short_name":"Forum - 130-134 - Track 3","id":45798},"spans_timebands":"N","updated":"2023-07-01T03:04:00.000-0000","begin":"2023-08-12T22:30:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"The Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) is a specialized microcontroller embedded on the motherboard, typically used in servers and other enterprise-level hardware.

Despite these challenges, frequency hopping can significantly enhance the security of consumer and DIY drones making much more challenging or even useless anti-drone systems’ role.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691880600,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691079660,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[50666,52146],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50851,52371],"name":"David Melendez","affiliations":[{"organization":"","title":"R&D Embedded Software Engineer"}],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-melendez-cano-0b195712/"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/@taiksontexas"},{"description":"","title":"Website","sort_order":0,"url":"http://taiksonprojects.blogspot.com/ "}],"media":[],"id":49960,"title":"R&D Embedded Software Engineer"}],"timeband_id":991,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-12T22:50:00.000-0000","id":52371,"tag_ids":[40287,45645,45646,45743],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691877600,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49960}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45692,"name":"Caesars Forum - Alliance - 311-312 - Hardware/Soldering Vlgs","hotel":"","short_name":"Alliance - 311-312 - Hardware/Soldering Vlgs","id":45868},"updated":"2023-08-03T16:21:00.000-0000","begin":"2023-08-12T22:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Put on your blue team hat and learn to detect and remediate compromises in your software delivery pipeline.

Previous attempts to utilize bioluminescent species either (1) introduced light generating genes into organisms that did not possess the physiology compatible with the energetic demand of light generation, (2) used organisms that were exceedingly sensitive to contamination or fluctuations in environmental conditions, or (3) used organisms with specialized light organs that cultivate glowing bacteria and cannot glow otherwise. The concepts we are proposing redefine the term ‘biotechnology’. Without a preceding, successful framework by which we can base our designs on, the burden of proof rests on us. Therefore, considerable time and effort must be placed into demonstrating that our vision is realistic, effective, and safe to the public. With our technology, the future is ever-glowing.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1689117240,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[51052],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51084],"name":"Del de Zela","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50238}],"timeband_id":991,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-12T22:30:00.000-0000","id":51084,"tag_ids":[45645,45647,45717],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691877000,"nanoseconds":0},"village_id":68,"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":50238}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45703,"name":"Flamingo - Laughlin I,II,III - Biohacking Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Laughlin I,II,III - Biohacking Village","id":45663},"spans_timebands":"N","updated":"2023-07-11T23:14:00.000-0000","begin":"2023-08-12T21:50:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"What does it mean to be an American today?

The ability to conduct free and fair elections is the cornerstone of any democratic society. However, in recent years, cybercriminals have exploited the vulnerability of social media platforms and unleashed sophisticated phishing attacks to manipulate public opinion and disrupt the democratic process.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we focus on the largest social phishing cyberattacks ever recorded during Brazil's election, where a staggering 156 million individuals were specifically targeted. These attacks, meticulously orchestrated and strategically timed, aimed to deceive and manipulate voters by spreading disinformation, creating confusion, and influencing their decision-making process.\r\n\r\nWe will explore the modus operandi of the cybercriminals behind these attacks, the techniques they employed to infiltrate the social media landscape, and the sophisticated psychological tactics utilized to exploit the vulnerabilities of the unsuspecting public. Moreover, we will analyze the significant consequences of these cyberattacks on the political climate, public trust, and the overall integrity of the electoral process.\r\n\r\nThroughout this presentation, we will also discuss the challenges faced by government authorities, law enforcement agencies, and technology companies in countering such threats. From advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to public awareness campaigns, we will explore various strategies implemented to mitigate the impact of social phishing cyberattacks and safeguard the democratic principles that Brazil holds dear.\r\n\r\nBy examining this case study, we aim to shed light on the growing need for enhanced cybersecurity measures, international collaboration, and comprehensive policies to prevent the recurrence of such incidents in future elections, not only in Brazil but also across the globe.

The RFC of the first version was released in 2014. Almost 10 years later, and with version 3 recently released, a far-reaching study of CSP deployment across the Internet was due.\r\n\r\nThe top one million most popular sites were scanned and their CSP related headers were stored. The values of the CSP headers were analysed to answer several questions. How popular is this security measure nowadays. What are common pitfalls and misconfigurations within CSP headers.

The RFC of the first version was released in 2014. Almost 10 years later, and with version 3 recently released, a far-reaching study of CSP deployment across the Internet was due.\r\n\r\nThe top one million most popular sites were scanned and their CSP related headers were stored. The values of the CSP headers were analysed to answer several questions. How popular is this security measure nowadays. What are common pitfalls and misconfigurations within CSP headers.

The team tries to resist the total state control of the Internet in Russia and fight not only for the freedom of speech, but for the freedom of information for millions of people.\r\n\r\nMeduza CTO will explain how one of the most free internet has become one of the most regulated and censored ones within just a couple of years. Alex will share the practical experience of resisting censorship along with his (pessimistic) forecast for the future of the Internet in Russia (a new \"Iron Curtain')'. He will describe how the authorities were once again able to “deceive the people'' (before all that happened, there were no abrupt blockings in Russia and the habit of using VPN was not formed among internet users). This is important to  not to let this scenario be repeated in whatever part of the world.  \r\n\r\nTech Dept has always been an important part of Meduza newsroom, but in 2022 the tech guys became an even more crucial part of it. It is thanks to their work that the newsroom is able to successfully bypass blocking and retain the audience in Russia. And to protect the journalists and to repel various DDoS attacks on the infrastructure and products.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES: \r\n\r\nWe don’t have many references that will be used in the presentation.

Their findings allowed us to confirm that the times in the metadata matches the actual times when the footage was recorded, and that the first video of the bodies couldn’t have been filmed after March 26, 2022, which proved that the horrific civilian killings in Bucha took place before Russian troops retreated from the town\r\n \r\n\r\n https://meduza.io/en/feature/2022/04/09/verified-video-appears-to-show-ukrainian-troops-killing-russian-captives-here-s-what-we-know-about-it\r\n \r\n An investigation of war crimes in Bogdanovka\r\n https://meduza.io/en/feature/2022/04/18/i-can-do-whatever-i-want-to-you\r\n \r\n How Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine split the company Yandex\r\n https://meduza.io/en/feature/2022/05/06/toxic-assets\r\n \r\n An investigation on Elvira Nabiullina, the chairwoman of Russia’s Central Bank\r\n https://meduza.io/en/feature/2022/07/07/the-banker-s-dilemma\r\n \r\n Meduza tells the story of the first openly transgender woman in the Russian army.

The success of QNNs motivates adversaries to attack QNNs via backdoors. However, na¨ıvely transplanting backdoors designed for classical neural networks to QNNs yields only low attack success rate, due to the noises and approximate synthesis on NISQ computers.

Dominion Voting Systems contracted with MITRE Corporation, a Federally Funded Contract Research and Development Center (FFRDC), to critique the Halderman/Springall report. Georgia election officials have cited the MITRE report in their decision to use unpatched versions of Dominion’s software in every precinct during the 2024 Presidential Election, despite CISA's warnings.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691767260,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[52331,52405],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52615,52700],"name":"David Jefferson","affiliations":[],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/drjefferson"}],"media":[],"id":51602},{"content_ids":[52405],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52700],"name":"Drew Springall","affiliations":[],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/_aaspring_"},{"description":"","title":"Website","sort_order":0,"url":"https://aaspring.com/"}],"media":[],"id":51624},{"content_ids":[52405],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52700],"name":"Richard DeMillo","affiliations":[],"links":[{"description":"","title":"Profile","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/richard-demillo"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/rad_atl"}],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51625}],"timeband_id":991,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-12T20:40:00.000-0000","id":52700,"tag_ids":[40298,45646,45743,45771],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691870100,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45631,"sort_order":1,"person_id":51602},{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":1,"person_id":51624},{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":1,"person_id":51625}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45694,"name":"Caesars Forum - Academy - 415-418 - Voting Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Academy - 415-418 - Voting Village","id":45872},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2023-08-12T19:55:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-11T15:21:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Siemens Healthineers leans into technology to bring medical devices closer to clinicians and more accessible for those that need the best medical attention.\r\n\r\nThrough our medical device cybersecurity program and our Virtual Reality training platform we can do just that. \r\n\r\nFor this session we will briefly talk about our programs and let interested individuals navigate our Virtual world or get hands on access to a mobile X-Ray system.\n\n\n","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","color":"#d86e9f","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","name":"Village Talk","id":45645},"title":"Medical VR","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691873400,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Siemens Healthineers leans into technology to bring medical devices closer to clinicians and more accessible for those that need the best medical attention.\r\n\r\nThrough our medical device cybersecurity program and our Virtual Reality training platform we can do just that. \r\n\r\nFor this session we will briefly talk about our programs and let interested individuals navigate our Virtual world or get hands on access to a mobile X-Ray system.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1689116880,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[51050],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51082],"name":"David Nathans","affiliations":[{"organization":"Siemens Healthcare","title":"Product Security Manager"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50243,"title":"Product Security Manager at Siemens Healthcare"},{"content_ids":[51050],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51082],"name":"Ernest Liu","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50244}],"timeband_id":991,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-12T20:50:00.000-0000","id":51082,"tag_ids":[45645,45647,45717],"village_id":68,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691869200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":50243},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":50244}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45703,"name":"Flamingo - Laughlin I,II,III - Biohacking Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Laughlin I,II,III - Biohacking Village","id":45663},"updated":"2023-07-11T23:08:00.000-0000","begin":"2023-08-12T19:40:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Terminals are ancient and dangerous beasts.

And Microsoft and Google also use custom OAuth to implement SSO among their app suites.\r\n\r\nThis protocol soup opens up more areas for abuse by attackers with key benefits: remotely-enabled attacks by design without need for endpoint compromise, near-permanent access, no need to go through MFA challenges, and incomplete controls for in preventing, detecting, and responding to these attacks.\r\n\r\nWe will demonstrate how these attacks work, what's different, how the underlying SSO protocols and features are abused, and where defensive measures fail.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1690921260,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[51986],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52180],"name":"Jenko Hwong","affiliations":[{"organization":"Netskope","title":"Principal Researcher, Threat Research Team"}],"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/jenkohwong"}],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51192,"title":"Principal Researcher, Threat Research Team at Netskope"}],"timeband_id":991,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-12T18:50:00.000-0000","id":52180,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[40284,45645,45647,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691863800,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":51192}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45703,"name":"Flamingo - Mesquite - Cloud Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Mesquite - Cloud Village","id":45653},"begin":"2023-08-12T18:10:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-01T20:21:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Anatomical medical simulators are an integral part of both medical training and experimentation, as well as implant biohacking.

BOTBs requires competitors to develop proof-of-concept exploits against varying misconfigured or vulnerable network services. To maximize points scored, the competitor’s bot must automatically scan and compromise network services in the competition environment autonomously.

Is Robbi innocent or guilty? Was something missing? How would you have cheated?\r\n\r\nREFERENCES: \r\n\r\n* Hancke, G. P. (n.d.).

Historically, tackling email-based threats has been considered the purview of black-box vendor solutions, with defenders having limited scope (or tooling!) to swiftly and effectively respond to emerging attacker activity and novel offensive tradecraft.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, attendees will be given detailed insight into the latest techniques used to deliver prevalent malware strains, including QakBot and Emotet, and will hunt through email data to identify this malicious activity, developing rules to detect and block these attacks.\r\n\r\nInitially attendees will be introduced to the foundational technologies that enable threat hunting, detection engineering, and response in the email domain, before being given access to the email data of a fictitious company seeded with benign and real-world attack data. Throughout the day, participants will learn to hunt common phishing techniques including:\r\n\r\n- VIP Impersonations\r\n- HTML smuggling via links/attachments\r\n- Malicious VBA macros\r\n- OneNote / LNK file malware (attachments, and links to auto-downloads)\r\n- PDF attachments with embedded links to malware (PDF -> URL -> ZIP -> WSF)\r\n- Lookalike domains / homoglyph attacks\r\n- Credential phishing\r\n- Password protected archives\r\n- Exploits (e.g. CVE-2023-23397, CVE-2021-40444)\r\n- Fake invoices (Geek Squad)\r\n\r\nAttendees will be guided through the rule creation process, utilizing free and open detection engines including Sublime and Yara, and will be introduced to the signals and email attributes that can be used to craft high-fidelity rules, including targeted user groups, sentiment analysis, sender domain age, and attachment analysis. Having completed the workshop, attendees will have a strong understanding of the tools and techniques at their disposal to defend their organizations from all manor of email threats.\r\n\r\nSkill Level: Beginner. The training will cater to security practitioners with any level of technical experience.

Historically, tackling email-based threats has been considered the purview of black-box vendor solutions, with defenders having limited scope (or tooling!) to swiftly and effectively respond to emerging attacker activity and novel offensive tradecraft.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, attendees will be given detailed insight into the latest techniques used to deliver prevalent malware strains, including QakBot and Emotet, and will hunt through email data to identify this malicious activity, developing rules to detect and block these attacks.\r\n\r\nInitially attendees will be introduced to the foundational technologies that enable threat hunting, detection engineering, and response in the email domain, before being given access to the email data of a fictitious company seeded with benign and real-world attack data. Throughout the day, participants will learn to hunt common phishing techniques including:\r\n\r\n- VIP Impersonations\r\n- HTML smuggling via links/attachments\r\n- Malicious VBA macros\r\n- OneNote / LNK file malware (attachments, and links to auto-downloads)\r\n- PDF attachments with embedded links to malware (PDF -> URL -> ZIP -> WSF)\r\n- Lookalike domains / homoglyph attacks\r\n- Credential phishing\r\n- Password protected archives\r\n- Exploits (e.g. CVE-2023-23397, CVE-2021-40444)\r\n- Fake invoices (Geek Squad)\r\n\r\nAttendees will be guided through the rule creation process, utilizing free and open detection engines including Sublime and Yara, and will be introduced to the signals and email attributes that can be used to craft high-fidelity rules, including targeted user groups, sentiment analysis, sender domain age, and attachment analysis. Having completed the workshop, attendees will have a strong understanding of the tools and techniques at their disposal to defend their organizations from all manor of email threats.\r\n\r\nSkill Level: Beginner. The training will cater to security practitioners with any level of technical experience. While a general understanding of email threats will be advantageous, all offensive and defensive techniques and tools in the training will be introduced at a foundational level and built on throughout the day.\r\n\r\nPrerequisites for students:\r\n- None\r\n\r\nMaterials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate: \r\n- Attendees should bring their own laptops in order to be hands-on, preloaded with Docker. Instructions to run the Docker images from Github will be shared.

Instead of general knowledge, the questions (or \"answers,\" in Jeopardy style) are focused on hacker culture, computer security, technology, and similar topics. The game consists of two preliminary rounds on Friday, and a final round on Saturday. Both shows start at 2000 Las Vegas time. Just like in the original game show, there are DFIU Doubles and a Final Hacker Jeopardy round. One unique aspect of Hacker Jeopardy that distinguishes it from the TV show is the incorporation of ADULT HUMOR, vulgarity, innuendo, and beer into the game.

The catchphrase for Hacker Jeopardy at DEF CON is \"Don't Forget It's UNIX\" (DFIU), which is used humorously due to the historically significant role of Unix-based systems in hacking and network security. This phrase is often used to remind participants of the roots of many computer systems and infrastructures.

HL7Magic will be open sourced and collaborations to improve it further will be welcomed.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES: \r\n\r\nForescout - Connected Medical Device Security: https://www.forescout.com/resources/connected-medical-device-security-a-deep-dive-into-healthcare-networks/\r\n\r\nDallas Haselhorst - HL7 Medical Attacking and Defending: https://linuxincluded.com/hl7-medical-attacking-defending/\r\n\r\nAnirudh Duggal - Understanding HL7 2.X Standards, Pen Testing and Defending HL7 2.X Messages: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR7cH44fjrc\r\n \r\nSaurabh Harit - Breaking Bad: Stealing Patient Data Through Medical Devices: https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-17/materials/eu-17-Harit-Breaking-Bad-Stealing-Patient-Data-Through-Medical-Devices.pdf\r\n \r\nChristian Dameff, Maxwell Bland, Kirill Levchenko, Jeff Tully - Pestilential Protocol: How Unsecure HL7 Messages Threaten Patient Lives: https://i.blackhat.com/us-18/Thu-August-9/us-18-Dameff-Pestilential-Protocol-How-Unsecure-HL7-Messages-Threaten-Patient-Lives-wp.pdf\r\n \r\nHL7apy: https://crs4.github.io/hl7apy/tutorial/index.html#","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1687137420,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[50562],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50784],"name":"Katie Inns","affiliations":[{"organization":"WithSecure","title":"Security Consultant"}],"pronouns":"she/her","links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/katie-inns/"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter (@J3lly____)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/J3lly____"}],"media":[],"id":49776,"title":"Security Consultant at WithSecure"}],"timeband_id":990,"links":[{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/245733"}],"end":"2023-08-12T00:20:00.000-0000","id":50784,"tag_ids":[45589,45592,45630,45646,45766],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691798400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Tool 🛠, Demo 💻","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49776}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45655,"name":"Caesars Forum - Forum - 109-119, 138-139 - Track 2","hotel":"","short_name":"Forum - 109-119, 138-139 - Track 2","id":45797},"updated":"2023-06-19T01:17:00.000-0000","begin":"2023-08-12T00:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"In this session we will cover what can be done to secure elections leading up to 2024.

However, to get the most out of the talk, attendees are encouraged to have a basic understanding of general Windows architecture, networking, and programming concepts. \r\n\r\nREFERENCES: \r\n[1] Pyle, Ned. “The Beginning of the End of Remote Mailslots.” Tech Community, Microsoft, 8 Mar. 2023, https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/storage-at-microsoft/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-remote-mailslots/ba-p/3762048.\r\n \r\n[2] Corporation, Microsoft. “[MS-Mail]: Remote Mailslot Protocol.” [MS-MAIL], Microsoft, 25 June 2021, https://winprotocoldoc.blob.core.windows.net/productionwindowsarchives/MS-MAIL/[MS-MAIL].pdf.\r\n \r\n[3] Aggarwal, Avnish. “PROTOCOL STANDARD FOR A NetBIOS SERVICE.” IETF, RFC Editor, Mar. 1987, https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1001.\r\n \r\n[4] ATT&CK, MITRE. “Enterprise Techniques.” Techniques - Enterprise ,\r\nMITRE ATT&CK, MITRE ATTCK, 25 Oct. 2022, https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/.\r\n \r\n[5] Yosifovich, Author Pavel. “Parent Process vs. Creator Process.” Pavel Yosifovich, 10 Jan. 2021, https://scorpiosoftware.net/2021/01/10/parent-process-vs-creator-process/.\r\n \r\n[6] Schwarz, Roland. “Thread Local Storage - the C++ WAY.” CodeProject, CodeProject, 28 Aug. 2004, https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/8113/Thread-Local-Storage-The-C-Way.\r\n \r\n[7] The Chromium Authors. “Chromium/thread_local_storage_win.Cc at Main · Chromium/Chromium.” GitHub, The Chromium Project, Jan. 2012, https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/main/base/threading/thread_local_storage_win.cc.\r\n \r\n[8] timb3r. “How to Find Hidden Threads - Threadhidefromdebugger - Antidebug Trick.” How to Find Hidden Threads - ThreadHideFromDebugger - AntiDebug Trick, Guided Hacking, 27 Dec. 2019, https://guidedhacking.com/threads/how-to-find-hidden-threads-threadhidefromdebugger-antidebug-trick.14281/.\r\n \r\n[9] Chappell, Geoff. “THREADINFOCLASS.” Threadinfoclass, Jan. 1997, https://www.geoffchappell.com/studies/windows/km/ntoskrnl/api/ps/psquery/class.htm.\r\n \r\n[10] GrantMeStrength. “GetMailslotInfo Function (Winbase.h) - win32 Apps.” Win32 Apps ,\r\nMicrosoft Learn, 10 Oct. 2021, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getmailslotinfo.\r\n \r\n[11] Alvinashcraft. “Impersonation Tokens - win32 Apps.” Win32 Apps ,\r\nMicrosoft Learn, 1 July 2021, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/impersonation-tokens.\r\n \r\n[12] GrantMeStrength. “CreateProcessWithTokenW Function (Winbase.h) - win32 Apps.” Win32 Apps ,\r\nMicrosoft Learn, 2 Jan. 2023, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-createprocesswithtokenw.\r\n \r\n[13] QuinnRadich. “WTSQUERYUSERTOKEN Function (WTSAPI32.H) - win32 Apps.” Win32 Apps ,\r\nMicrosoft Learn, 10 Dec. 2021, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wtsapi32/nf-wtsapi32-wtsqueryusertoken.\r\n \r\n[14] Karl-Bridge-Microsoft. “PEB (Winternl.h) - win32 Apps.” PEB (Winternl.h) - Win32 Apps ,\r\nMicrosoft Learn, 31 Aug. 2022, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/ns-winternl-peb.\r\n \r\n[15] Yosifovich, Pavel.

Generative AI is poised to accelerate that trend. Our collective stream of information is surging, but all too often it's filled with misinformation. As audiences and fact checkers confront these muddied waters, could there be solutions back upstream? Researchers are testing innovative ways to authenticate digital records at their origin, establishing the time, date and location of their creation. With enhanced provenance we can establish a new resilient form of authenticity with cryptography, and decentralized systems. These methods have been used to establish trust in critical records like photos and web archives, and recently used in stories published by Reuters, Rolling Stone, Associated Press, Inside Climate News, and Bay City News. The techniques are even finding their way into legal submissions to prosecutors at the International Criminal Court and helping preserve the testimony of the survivors of genocide.

Generative AI is poised to accelerate that trend. Our collective stream of information is surging, but all too often it's filled with misinformation. As audiences and fact checkers confront these muddied waters, could there be solutions back upstream? Researchers are testing innovative ways to authenticate digital records at their origin, establishing the time, date and location of their creation. With enhanced provenance we can establish a new resilient form of authenticity with cryptography, and decentralized systems. These methods have been used to establish trust in critical records like photos and web archives, and recently used in stories published by Reuters, Rolling Stone, Associated Press, Inside Climate News, and Bay City News. The techniques are even finding their way into legal submissions to prosecutors at the International Criminal Court and helping preserve the testimony of the survivors of genocide.

Get a sense of the types of use cases you can explore now, including examples of the performance edges you can expect today.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691794800,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691108460,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[52180,52412],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52708,52428],"name":"Konstantinos Karagiannis","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51429}],"timeband_id":990,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-11T23:00:00.000-0000","id":52428,"tag_ids":[40291,45645,45649,45743],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691791200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":51429}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45738,"name":"LINQ - 3rd flr - Quantum Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Quantum Village","id":45741},"begin":"2023-08-11T22:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-04T00:21:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Join Steve Luczynski in a fireside chat with with David Pekoske, Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration.\n\n\n","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","color":"#d86e9f","name":"Village Talk","id":45645},"title":"A Fireside Chat with the TSA Administrator","android_description":"Join Steve Luczynski in a fireside chat with with David Pekoske, Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691794200,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691101140,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[50640,52153],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50841,52383],"name":"David Pekoske","affiliations":[{"organization":"Transportation Security Administration (TSA)","title":"Administrator"}],"pronouns":"he/him","links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/TSA_Pekoske"}],"media":[],"id":49914,"title":"Administrator at Transportation Security Administration (TSA)"},{"content_ids":[52153],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52383],"name":"Steve Luczynski","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51420}],"timeband_id":990,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-11T22:50:00.000-0000","id":52383,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[40280,45645,45646,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691791200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49914},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":51420}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45719,"name":"Caesars Forum - Summit - 208-214 - Aerospace Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Summit - 208-214 - Aerospace Village","id":45859},"updated":"2023-08-03T22:19:00.000-0000","begin":"2023-08-11T22:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"When radiation detectors are mentioned, one tends to think of the geiger counter.

As the balloon goes up it expands and pops at an altitude up to 33 Km (110K feet) above the earth.The flight payload is called a radiosonde. It measures pressure, temperature, relative humidity, position, and velocity during its flight, and transmits the data to a sounding receiver. One or two missing weather balloons won't impact the daily forecast. However, many missing balloons could lead to errors in weather models and forecasts. Weather balloons are also important for gathering weather data for satellite launches and human spaceflights, as launches are often delayed or scrubbed due to upper-level wind shear.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I present a simulation framework for the most popular radiosonde model.

As the balloon goes up it expands and pops at an altitude up to 33 Km (110K feet) above the earth.The flight payload is called a radiosonde. It measures pressure, temperature, relative humidity, position, and velocity during its flight, and transmits the data to a sounding receiver. One or two missing weather balloons won't impact the daily forecast. However, many missing balloons could lead to errors in weather models and forecasts. Weather balloons are also important for gathering weather data for satellite launches and human spaceflights, as launches are often delayed or scrubbed due to upper-level wind shear.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I present a simulation framework for the most popular radiosonde model. It enables an attacker to generate radiosonde messages or alter logged messages for retransmission. I also present simulations of a jamming attack and a spoofing attack on a sounding receiver:\r\n\r\nDuring a jamming attack, the receiver is unable to receive transmissions from active radiosondes.\r\n\r\nDuring a spoofing attack, the transmitter sends fake radiosonde messages to a target receiver, identifying as an active radiosonde.\r\n\r\nI'll talk about the shortcomings of the military variant of the radiosonde model and suggest a simple way to cope with spoofing attacks.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\nVredenbregt L., \"How many weather balloons are out there?

We know the risks to elections, now how do we create partnerships and build competencies to take on the implications?","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691435760,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[52329,52334,52337],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52613,52618,52621,52622],"name":"Catherine Terranova","affiliations":[],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherine-terranova-8b209826a"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/catlovesvoting"},{"description":"","title":"Village Website","sort_order":0,"url":"https://votingvillage.org"}],"media":[],"id":51533},{"content_ids":[52328,52334,52336],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52612,52618,52620],"name":"Maia Mazurkiewicz","affiliations":[],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Link","sort_order":0,"url":"https://alliance4europe.eu/"},{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maia-mazurkiewicz/"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/MaiaMazurkiewic"}],"media":[],"id":51549},{"content_ids":[52334],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52618],"name":"Maria Bique","affiliations":[],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Link","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.cybercoach.com/"},{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/biquemaria"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/MariaBique"}],"media":[],"id":51550},{"content_ids":[52329,52334],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52613,52618],"name":"Sandra Khalil","affiliations":[],"links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/khalilsandra"}],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51555}],"timeband_id":990,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-11T22:20:00.000-0000","id":52618,"tag_ids":[40298,45646,45743,45771],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691789400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":1,"person_id":51533},{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":1,"person_id":51549},{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":1,"person_id":51550},{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":1,"person_id":51555}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45694,"name":"Caesars Forum - Academy - 415-418 - Voting Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Academy - 415-418 - Voting Village","id":45872},"begin":"2023-08-11T21:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-07T19:16:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Sure, you’ve got skills to “build the stuff and do the thing.” But how good are you at talking to non-techs, execs, and the general public about why what you’re doing is important?

Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) manually inspect ballots from a trustworthy record of the votes to provide affirmative evidence that electoral outcomes are correct if they are indeed correct, and to correct any outcomes that are wrong. When the outcome is correct, RLAs may inspect only a small fraction of all ballot cards, saving considerable labor compared to a full manual recount. Using information about which ballot cards contain which contests (card-style data, CSD) further reduces labor.

Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) manually inspect ballots from a trustworthy record of the votes to provide affirmative evidence that electoral outcomes are correct if they are indeed correct, and to correct any outcomes that are wrong. When the outcome is correct, RLAs may inspect only a small fraction of all ballot cards, saving considerable labor compared to a full manual recount. Using information about which ballot cards contain which contests (card-style data, CSD) further reduces labor. In this talk, I give an overview of how RLAs work, and new advancements that substantially reduce workload. Using data from the 2020 and 2022 general elections in Orange County, I demonstrate the efficiency of RLAs that take into account CSD.

It covers a potential gap in proactive phishing detection and prevention strategies and can be easily integrated into existing open-source tools like dnstwist.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691076540,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[52093],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52319],"name":"Gal Bitensky","affiliations":[],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":null,"title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gal-bitensky/"},{"description":null,"title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/Gal_B1t"}],"media":[],"id":51340}],"timeband_id":990,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-11T22:00:00.000-0000","id":52319,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[40297,45647,45743,45775],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691784000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":51340}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45712,"name":"Flamingo - Savoy - AppSec Village - Pod 2","hotel":"","short_name":"AppSec Village - Pod 2","id":45963},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2023-08-11T20:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-03T15:29:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"","title":"AMA - Tib3rius","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","color":"#60b0ba","name":"Village Activity","id":45775},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691791200,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691076540,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[52092],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[52318],"name":"Tib3rius","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51380}],"timeband_id":990,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-11T22:00:00.000-0000","id":52318,"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691784000,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[40297,45647,45743,45775],"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":51380}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45712,"name":"Flamingo - Savoy - AppSec Village - Pod 1","hotel":"","short_name":"AppSec Village - Pod 1","id":45962},"spans_timebands":"N","updated":"2023-08-03T15:29:00.000-0000","begin":"2023-08-11T20:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Web Shells are malicious web applications used for remote access and.

Hugging Face is used by over 22,000 organizations, including Intel and Microsoft, has supported more than 2.6 billion model downloads, and is rapidly growing.

We collected more than 110,000 Hugging Face models and over 29,000 GitHub repositories.

This session establishes a baseline for many of the Policy @ DEF CON content to follow.\r\n\r\nThis is a double length session lasting 110 minutes.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1690984140,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[51500],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51656],"name":"Adam Dobell","affiliations":[{"organization":"Department of Home Affairs, Embassy of Australia, Washington DC","title":"First Secretary"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50569,"title":"First Secretary at Department of Home Affairs, Embassy of Australia, Washington DC"},{"content_ids":[51500],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51656],"name":"Ari Schwartz","affiliations":[{"organization":"Center for Cybersecurity Policy and Law","title":"Executive Coordinator"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50575,"title":"Executive Coordinator at Center for Cybersecurity Policy and Law"},{"content_ids":[51500,51504],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51656,51660],"name":"Bryony Crown","affiliations":[{"organization":"British Embassy, Washington D.C.","title":"First Secretary Cyber Policy"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50583,"title":"First Secretary Cyber Policy at British Embassy, Washington D.C."},{"content_ids":[51509,51514,51500],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51656,51670,51665],"name":"Peter Stephens","affiliations":[{"organization":"OECD","title":""}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50630,"title":"OECD"},{"content_ids":[51500],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51656],"name":"Peter Brown","affiliations":[{"organization":"Strategy and Innovation Unit of the European Parliament","title":"Senior Policy Adviser"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":51244,"title":"Senior Policy Adviser at Strategy and Innovation Unit of the European Parliament"}],"timeband_id":990,"end":"2023-08-11T20:50:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Feedback","type":"link","url":"https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3eGdwIOCKgfEozY"}],"id":51656,"tag_ids":[40310,45646,45743,45773,45836],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691780400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":50569},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":50575},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":50583},{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":1,"person_id":51244},{"tag_id":45631,"sort_order":1,"person_id":50630}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45719,"name":"Caesars Forum - Summit - 221-222 - Policy Atrium","hotel":"","short_name":"Summit - 221-222 - Policy Atrium","id":45878},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2023-08-11T19:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-02T13:49:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"","title":"ICS Village - TSA Keynote","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","color":"#d86e9f","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","name":"Village Talk","id":45645},"android_description":"","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691785800,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1690422720,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[51477],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51633],"name":"Tim Weston","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50564}],"timeband_id":990,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-11T20:30:00.000-0000","id":51633,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[40306,45645,45646,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691780400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":50564}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45692,"name":"Caesars Forum - Alliance - 313-319 - ICS Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Alliance - 313-319 - ICS Village","id":45869},"begin":"2023-08-11T19:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-07-27T01:52:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Organizations seek rapid intelligence about critical situations that impact their teams, locations, or assets.

Ek47 payloads are themselves .NET assemblies and can be uploaded to disk or executed reflectively via any execute-assembly method. By default, a standard AMSI/ETW bypass is executed before the main payload is executed, but Ek47 makes it easy to add custom bypasses for more advanced evasion functionality. Additional miscellaneous features are provided such as entropy management, PE header stomping, and generation of service executables.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1688876220,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[50629,51001],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50737,51039],"name":"Kevin “Kent” Clark","affiliations":[{"organization":"TrustedSec","title":"Security Consultant"},{"organization":"BC Security","title":"Red Team Instructor"}],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Blog","sort_order":0,"url":"https://henpeebin.com/kevin/blog"}],"media":[],"id":49886,"title":"Red Team Instructor at BC Security"},{"content_ids":[51001],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51039],"name":"Skyler Knecht","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50180}],"timeband_id":990,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-11T20:55:00.000-0000","id":51039,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45592,45636,45646,45743],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691780400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Demo 💻","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49886},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":50180}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45636,"name":"Caesars Forum - Committee Boardroom - Demo Labs","hotel":"","short_name":"Committee Boardroom - Demo Labs","id":45698},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2023-08-11T19:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-07-09T04:17:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Dracon is an open-source Application and Cloud security automation framework that helps organizations create security workflows and improve their security posture.

The reasons for their use are manifold, although some people may use them to dissemble their true identity. Prepaid smartphones offer value, but there may be an additional \"cost\" for their cheap price. We present an examination of the local attack surface of 21 prepaid Android smartphones sold by American carriers (and 11 unlocked smartphones). While examining these devices, we discovered instances of arbitrary command execution in the context of a \"system\" user app, arbitrary AT command execution, arbitrary file write in the context of the Android System (i.e., \"system_server\"), arbitrary file read/write in the context of a \"system\" user app, programmatic factory reset, leakage of GPS coordinates to a loopback port, numerous exposures of non-resettable device identifiers to system properties, and more.\r\n\r\nThe only user interaction that our threat model assumes is that the user installs and runs a third-party app that has no permissions or only a single \"normal\" level permission that is automatically granted to the third-party app upon installation. The installed third-party app can leverage flaws in pre-loaded software to escalate privileges to indirectly perform actions or obtain data while lacking the necessary privileges to do so directly. Due to a wide range of local interfaces with missing access control checks and inadequate input validation, a third-party app’s behavior is not truly circumscribed by the permissions that it requests. Due to the common inclusion of pre-loaded software from Android vendors, chipset manufacturers, carriers, and vendor partners, exploit code can have significant breadth. The inter-app communication used to exploit these vulnerabilities may be difficult to classify as inherently malicious in general since it uses the standard communication channels employed by non-malicious apps.\r\n\r\nWe pick up again where we left off from our DEF CON 26 talk … raiding the prepaid Android smartphone aisles at Walmart. We provide another snapshot on the state of security for Android carrier devices. In this talk, we examine 21 different prepaid Android smartphones being sold by the major American carriers, and we also cover 11 unlocked Android devices, which are primarily ZTE smartphones. We identified vulnerabilities in multiple layers of the Android software stack. For each discovered vulnerability, we step through the attack requirements, access vector, and attack workflow in order to help developers and bug hunters identify common software flaws going forward.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nhttps://support.zte.com.cn/support/news/LoopholeInfoDetail.aspx?newsId=1030664\r\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oneplus-phones-come-preinstalled-with-a-factory-app-that-can-root-devices/\r\nhttps://source.android.com/docs/security/features/selinux#background\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem\r\nhttps://github.com/thanuj10/Nokia-Debloater\r\nhttps://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids#best-practices-android-identifiers\r\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/hardware/ril/+/master/include/telephony/ril.h\r\nhttps://github.com/lbule/android_hardware_mediatek\r\nhttps://security.tecno.com/SRC/blogdetail/99?lang=en_US\r\nhttps://extensionpublications.unl.edu/assets/pdf/ec157.pdf\r\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/java/android/service/persistentdata/PersistentDataBlockManager.java#143\r\nhttps://github.com/ptoomey3/evilarc/blob/master/evilarc.py\r\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/packages/SystemUI/\r\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Settings/+/refs/heads/master\n\n\n","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","color":"#2c8f07","name":"DEF CON Official Talk","id":45589},"title":"Still Vulnerable Out of the Box: Revisiting the Security of Prepaid Android Carrier Devices","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691783100,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Prepaid Android smartphones present an attractive option since they can be used and discarded at will without significant financial cost.

The inter-app communication used to exploit these vulnerabilities may be difficult to classify as inherently malicious in general since it uses the standard communication channels employed by non-malicious apps.\r\n\r\nWe pick up again where we left off from our DEF CON 26 talk … raiding the prepaid Android smartphone aisles at Walmart. We provide another snapshot on the state of security for Android carrier devices. In this talk, we examine 21 different prepaid Android smartphones being sold by the major American carriers, and we also cover 11 unlocked Android devices, which are primarily ZTE smartphones. We identified vulnerabilities in multiple layers of the Android software stack. For each discovered vulnerability, we step through the attack requirements, access vector, and attack workflow in order to help developers and bug hunters identify common software flaws going forward.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\nhttps://support.zte.com.cn/support/news/LoopholeInfoDetail.aspx?newsId=1030664\r\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oneplus-phones-come-preinstalled-with-a-factory-app-that-can-root-devices/\r\nhttps://source.android.com/docs/security/features/selinux#background\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem\r\nhttps://github.com/thanuj10/Nokia-Debloater\r\nhttps://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids#best-practices-android-identifiers\r\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/hardware/ril/+/master/include/telephony/ril.h\r\nhttps://github.com/lbule/android_hardware_mediatek\r\nhttps://security.tecno.com/SRC/blogdetail/99?lang=en_US\r\nhttps://extensionpublications.unl.edu/assets/pdf/ec157.pdf\r\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/java/android/service/persistentdata/PersistentDataBlockManager.java#143\r\nhttps://github.com/ptoomey3/evilarc/blob/master/evilarc.py\r\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/packages/SystemUI/\r\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Settings/+/refs/heads/master","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1688182980,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[50668],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50797],"name":"Ryan Johnson","affiliations":[{"organization":"Quokka","title":"Senior Director, R&D"}],"links":[],"pronouns":"he/him","media":[],"id":49964,"title":"Senior Director, R&D at Quokka"},{"content_ids":[50668],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50797],"name":"Angelos Stavrou","affiliations":[{"organization":"Quokka","title":"Founder and Chief Scientist"}],"links":[],"pronouns":"he/him","media":[],"id":49965,"title":"Founder and Chief Scientist at Quokka"},{"content_ids":[50668],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50797],"name":"Mohamed Elsabagh","affiliations":[{"organization":"Quokka","title":"Senior Director, R&D"}],"links":[],"pronouns":"he/him","media":[],"id":49966,"title":"Senior Director, R&D at Quokka"}],"timeband_id":990,"end":"2023-08-11T19:45:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Quokka","type":"link","url":"https://www.quokka.io"},{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/246121"}],"id":50797,"tag_ids":[45589,45592,45629,45646,45766],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691780400,"nanoseconds":0},"village_id":null,"includes":"Demo 💻, Exploit 🪲","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49965},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49966},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49964}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45655,"name":"Caesars Forum -

The following is a description of the five attacks introduced in this presentation.\r\n\r\n - Malicious Custom Action - Two attack techniques are going to be introduced in this section: Malicious JScript Composite Action and Malicious JavaScript Custom Action. Malicious JScript Composite Action is a developed custom action that performs an attack using JScript, after replacing the script engine from node.exe to wscript.exe through Binary Hijacking and Masquerading. Malicious JavaScript Custom Action performs the attack from Nodejs implemented using its C++ addons.\r\n - GitHub Actions C2 - We will demonstrate a new C2 framework using self-hosted runner in GitHub Actions. This C2 has been developed using Runner Application, a GitHub Action's agent, to execute commands and download/upload files via GitHub Actions. The C2 achieves stealthiness by utilizing official binaries provided by GitHub and communicating only with GitHub owned domains and IPs.\r\n - Free Jacking - We will introduce the results of my investigation into attacks using free cloud resources, known as \"Free Jacking,\" including the attack actually used by attackers and its changes according to GitHub's countermeasures.\r\n - Public Malicious Fork and PR - We will briefly discuss an Initial Foothold being established through repository configuration or developer operation errors when using self-hosted runners.\r\n - Theft of Secret - We will also provide an overview of the threat of theft of secrets, where encrypted environment variables used within GitHub are stolen from GitHub Actions, based on discussions among researchers.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have systematized the above five attacks based on two perspectives: - GitHub Actions features, such as repository ownership and runner types. - Threat level, including severity and probability.

To study RDP attacks, we created PyRDP, an open-source RDP interception tool with unmatched capabilities which helped us collect more than 100 hours of video footage of attackers in action.\r\n\r\nTo describe attackers’ behaviors, we characterized the various archetypes of threat actors in groups based on their traits through a Dungeon & Dragons analogy: 1) the Bards making obtuse search or watch unholy videos; 2) the Rangers stealthily explore computers and perform reconnaissance; 3) the Thieves try to monetize the RDP access; 4)the Barbarians use a large array of tools to brute-force their way into more computers; and 5) the Wizardsuse their RDP access as a magic portal to cloak their origins.

These vulnerabilities were found using a fuzzer we developed and will release to the community. \r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n \r\n* https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-03/bh-us-03-convery-franz-v3.pdf\r\n* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4272\r\n* https://www.oecd.org/publications/routing-security-40be69c8-en.htm\r\n* https://www.zdnet.com/article/internet-experiment-goes-wrong-takes-down-a-bunch-of-linux-routers/","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1687136280,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[50549],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50830],"name":"Daniel dos Santos","affiliations":[{"organization":"Forescout","title":"Head of Security Research"}],"pronouns":"he/him","links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielricardosantos/"}],"media":[],"id":49759,"title":"Head of Security Research at Forescout"},{"content_ids":[50549],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50830],"name":"Simon Guiot","affiliations":[{"organization":"Forescout","title":"Security Researcher"}],"pronouns":"he/him","links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/si-g/"}],"media":[],"id":49760,"title":"Security Researcher at Forescout"}],"timeband_id":990,"end":"2023-08-11T18:15:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/245718"}],"id":50830,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45589,45592,45629,45646,45766],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691775000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Exploit 🪲, Demo 💻","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49759},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49760}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45694,"name":"Caesars Forum - Academy - 407-410 - Track 4","hotel":"","short_name":"Academy - 407-410 - Track 4","id":45799},"begin":"2023-08-11T17:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-06-19T00:58:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"","title":"Making The DEF CON 31 Badge","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","color":"#2c8f07","name":"DEF CON Official Talk","id":45589},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691776200,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1688219880,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[50678],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50800],"name":"Mar Williams","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":49976}],"timeband_id":990,"links":[],"end":"2023-08-11T17:50:00.000-0000","id":50800,"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691775000,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[45589,45646,45766],"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49976}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45655,"name":"Caesars Forum - Forum - 109-119, 138-139 - Track 2","hotel":"","short_name":"Forum - 109-119, 138-139 - Track 2","id":45797},"spans_timebands":"N","updated":"2023-07-01T13:58:00.000-0000","begin":"2023-08-11T17:30:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"New to lock picking?

Additionally, we will have many challenges which we simply haven’t had time or ability to virtualize. Playing only the virtual game will severely limit the maximum available points which you can score, therefore don’t expect to place. If you play virtual only, consider the game an opportunity to learn, practice, hone your skills, and still get on the scoreboard for bragging rights.

The diverse perspectives will cover policy, current activities, and include engagement with the audience to troubleshoot potential solutions on how we can collaboratively work to grow and sustain the hacker talent pipeline.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1690430640,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[51504],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51660],"name":"Ashley Sequeira","affiliations":[{"organization":"Google Cloud Security","title":"Security Operations Sales Engineering Training Program Manager"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50576,"title":"Security Operations Sales Engineering Training Program Manager at Google Cloud Security"},{"content_ids":[51504],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51660],"name":"Ayan Islam","affiliations":[{"organization":"Office of the National Cyber Director, The White House","title":"Director, Cyber Workforce"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50578,"title":"Director, Cyber Workforce at Office of the National Cyber Director, The White House"},{"content_ids":[51500,51504],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51656,51660],"name":"Bryony Crown","affiliations":[{"organization":"British Embassy, Washington D.C.","title":"First Secretary Cyber Policy"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50583,"title":"First Secretary Cyber Policy at British Embassy, Washington D.C."},{"content_ids":[51504],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51660],"name":"Randy Pestana","affiliations":[{"organization":"FIU Jack D Gordon Institute for Public Policy","title":"Associate Director"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50632,"title":"Associate Director at FIU Jack D Gordon Institute for Public Policy"},{"content_ids":[51504,51519],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51660,51675],"name":"Safa Shahwan Edwards","affiliations":[{"organization":"Atlantic Council","title":"Deputy Director, Cyber Statecraft Initiative"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50634,"title":"Deputy Director, Cyber Statecraft Initiative at Atlantic Council"},{"content_ids":[51504,51511],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[51660,51667],"name":"Sarah Powazek","affiliations":[{"organization":"UC Berkeley Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity (CLTC)","title":"Program Director of Public Interest Cybersecurity"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":50635,"title":"Program Director of Public Interest Cybersecurity at UC Berkeley Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity (CLTC)"}],"timeband_id":990,"links":[{"label":"Feedback","type":"link","url":"https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3eGdwIOCKgfEozY"}],"end":"2023-08-11T18:50:00.000-0000","id":51660,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691773200,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[40310,45646,45743,45771],"village_id":null,"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":1,"person_id":50576},{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":1,"person_id":50578},{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":1,"person_id":50583},{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":1,"person_id":50632},{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":1,"person_id":50634},{"tag_id":45632,"sort_order":1,"person_id":50635}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45719,"name":"Caesars Forum - Summit - 218-219 - Policy Rotunda","hotel":"","short_name":"Summit - 218-219 - Policy Rotunda","id":45824},"updated":"2023-07-27T04:04:00.000-0000","begin":"2023-08-11T17:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"This is your CliffsNotes on what's happening in US cyber policy.

We are looking for inexperienced players on up to the SIGINT secret squirrels to play our games. The RFCTF can be played with a little knowledge, a pen tester’s determination, and $0 to $$$$$ worth of special equipment. Our new virtual RFCTF can be played completely remotely without needing any specialized equipment at all, just using your web browser! The key is to read the clues, determine the goal of each challenge, and have fun learning.\r\n\r\nThere will be clues everywhere, and we will provide periodic updates via discord and twitter. Make sure you pay attention to what’s happening at the RFCTF desk, #rfctf on our discord, on Twitter @rf_ctf, @rfhackers, and the interwebz, etc. If you have a question - ASK! We may or may not answer, at our discretion.\r\n\r\nFOR THE NEW FOLKS\r\n\r\nOur virtual RFCTF environment is played remotely over ssh or through a web browser. It may help to have additional tools installed on your local machine, but it is not required.\r\n\r\nRead the presentations at: https://rfhackers.com/resources\r\n\r\nHybrid Fun\r\n\r\nFor DEF CON 31 we will be running in “Hybrid” mode. That means we will have both a physical presence AND the virtual game running simultaneously. All of the challenges we have perfected in the last 2 years in our virtual game will be up and running, available to anyone all over the world (including at the conference), entirely free. In addition to the virtual challenges, we will also have a large number of “in person” only challenges, which do require valid conference admission. These “in-person” only challenges will include our traditional fox hunts, hide and seeks, and king of the hill challenges. Additionally, we will have many challenges which we simply haven’t had time or ability to virtualize. Playing only the virtual game will severely limit the maximum available points which you can score, therefore don’t expect to place. If you play virtual only, consider the game an opportunity to learn, practice, hone your skills, and still get on the scoreboard for bragging rights. The virtual challenges which are available will have the same flags as the in-person challenges, allowing physical attendees the choice of hacking those challenges using either (or both) methods of access.\r\n\r\nTHE GAME\r\n\r\nTo score you will need to submit flags which will range from decoding transmissions in the spectrum, passphrases used to gain access to wireless access points, or even files located on servers. Once you capture the flag, submit it to the scoreboard right away, if you are confident it is correct. Flags will be worth less points the more often they are solved. Offense and defense are fully in play by the participants, the RFCTF organizers, and the Conference itself. Play nice, and we might also play nice.\r\n\r\nGetting started guide: https://github.com/rfhs/rfhs-wiki/wiki\r\n\r\nHelpful files (in-brief, wordlist, resources) can be found at https://github.com/rfhs/rfctf-files\r\n\r\nSupport tickets may be opened at https://github.com/rfhs/rfctf-support/issues\r\n\r\nOur whole game is also open source and available at: https://github.com/rfhs/rfctf-container\n\n\n","type":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","color":"#cf74e1","name":"Contest","id":45635},"title":"Radio Frequency Capture the Flag","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691802000,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Do you have what it takes to hack WiFi, Bluetooth, and Software Defined Radio (SDR)?\r\n\r\nRF Hackers Sanctuary (the group formerly known as Wireless Village) is once again holding the Radio Frequency Capture the Flag (RFCTF) at DEF CON 31.

We may or may not answer, at our discretion.\r\n\r\nFOR THE NEW FOLKS\r\n\r\nOur virtual RFCTF environment is played remotely over ssh or through a web browser. It may help to have additional tools installed on your local machine, but it is not required.\r\n\r\nRead the presentations at: https://rfhackers.com/resources\r\n\r\nHybrid Fun\r\n\r\nFor DEF CON 31 we will be running in “Hybrid” mode. That means we will have both a physical presence AND the virtual game running simultaneously. All of the challenges we have perfected in the last 2 years in our virtual game will be up and running, available to anyone all over the world (including at the conference), entirely free. In addition to the virtual challenges, we will also have a large number of “in person” only challenges, which do require valid conference admission. These “in-person” only challenges will include our traditional fox hunts, hide and seeks, and king of the hill challenges. Additionally, we will have many challenges which we simply haven’t had time or ability to virtualize. Playing only the virtual game will severely limit the maximum available points which you can score, therefore don’t expect to place. If you play virtual only, consider the game an opportunity to learn, practice, hone your skills, and still get on the scoreboard for bragging rights. The virtual challenges which are available will have the same flags as the in-person challenges, allowing physical attendees the choice of hacking those challenges using either (or both) methods of access.\r\n\r\nTHE GAME\r\n\r\nTo score you will need to submit flags which will range from decoding transmissions in the spectrum, passphrases used to gain access to wireless access points, or even files located on servers. Once you capture the flag, submit it to the scoreboard right away, if you are confident it is correct. Flags will be worth less points the more often they are solved. Offense and defense are fully in play by the participants, the RFCTF organizers, and the Conference itself. Play nice, and we might also play nice.\r\n\r\nGetting started guide: https://github.com/rfhs/rfhs-wiki/wiki\r\n\r\nHelpful files (in-brief, wordlist, resources) can be found at https://github.com/rfhs/rfctf-files\r\n\r\nSupport tickets may be opened at https://github.com/rfhs/rfctf-support/issues\r\n\r\nOur whole game is also open source and available at: https://github.com/rfhs/rfctf-container","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1690939380,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"timeband_id":990,"links":[{"label":"Website","type":"link","url":"http://rfhackers.com"},{"label":"Twitter (@rf_ctf)","type":"link","url":"https://twitter.com/@rf_ctf"},{"label":"Support","type":"link","url":"https://github.com/rfhs/rfctf-support/issues"},{"label":"Discord","type":"link","url":"https://discordapp.com/invite/JjPQhKy"},{"label":"Twitter (@rfhackers)","type":"link","url":"https://twitter.com/@rfhackers"},{"label":"Github","type":"link","url":"https://github.com/rfhs"}],"end":"2023-08-12T01:00:00.000-0000","id":51502,"village_id":58,"tag_ids":[40292,45635,45647,45766],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691773200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45703,"name":"Flamingo - Eldorado - Radio Frequency Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Eldorado - Radio Frequency Village","id":45714},"begin":"2023-08-11T17:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-08-02T01:23:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Do you have what it takes to go up against Mayhem Industries' latest maleficent project?

CTI enables enhanced decisions and to get ahead of the cyber attack. But how can I apply CTI and use it? The game \"IntelOps - Operation Spacewatch\" aims to improve players' understanding of CTI. Participants learn about different frameworks, sources and types of CTI and how they can use CTI data in a fun way. The game is built to not only teach terms and theory but apply CTI in a real-world context.\r\nThe game is based on four major CTI and cyber security models. These are the NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF), MITRE ATT&CK Matrix, the Cyber Kill Chain and the Pyramid of Pain. \r\nAs a player, you are part of the United Nations (UN) CTI team and assigned to the mission to stop the attack on the satellite constellation. Your task is to use the available CTI your team has collected and assist the other members of the UN Cyber Protection Team (CPT).\r\nThe players find themselves in a near future scenario where every nation has access to ballistic-launched nuclear weapons. For monitoring and control purposes, the United Nations has established a global satellite defense system to detect ballistic and hypersonic missile launches. The defense system allows the UN to be able to react immediately when suspicious activities on the weapons are detected. A global hacker network is threatening to disable the satellite constellation to use nuclear weapons for their purposes.\r\nThere are 32 satellites in the global defense system your team has to protect. If 4 or more satellites are compromised and deactivated, the hacker network successfully disenabled the defense system and can take control of the nuclear weapons. It is your mission to protect the satellite network and ensure the availability of the global defense system.\r\n\r\nThe players are provided with the following game components:\r\n- CTI information in form of a card deck;\r\n- An overview of the satellite network and the satellite’s availability status;\r\n- The status and progress of the cyber attackpresented with the Cyber Kill Chain;\r\n- The Pyramid of Pain to allocate and classify the CTI data;\r\n- A NIST CSF game board to place and apply the CTI information;\r\n- Scenario description.\r\n\r\nWhile the CTI cards and the NIST CSF game board are provided as physical components, the Cyber Kill Chain, the satellite network and the Pyramid of Pain will be displayed on a monitor managed through a laptop by the game facilitators.\r\n\r\nSummary of gameplay\r\nThe CTI cards must be played strategically to stop the cyber attack. The number of cards and information as well as the number of packages that can be sent to the satellites are limited. The CTI cards must be applied to each NIST CSF phase. Each phase of the NIST CSF has limited fields for applying the CTI information. The limitation is based on the limited number of packets that can be sent to the satellite network. The game includes four turns in total to save the satellite network. Depending on the effectiveness of the CTI application, there is a chance to stop the attack at every turn. The status of the cyber attack and the effectiveness of the applied CTI information is presented with the help of the Cyber Kill Chain. It represents the attacker's view. If the chosen CTI strategy and application were not successful, the team loses a satellite to the hacker network. In this case, the colour of a satellite on the monitor changes from red to green.\r\n\r\nGame duration\r\nEvery game last 20 minutes in total.

Items are submitted at the table, better than average submissions shall be awarded bonus points. The team who turns in the most points by Sunday at noon will win the admiration of your like-minded peers.\r\n \r\n The DEF CON Scavenger Hunt is one of the longest running contests at DEF CON, visit https://defconscavhunt.com for a history lesson.\r\n \r\n If you capture pictures or video of items from our list, or have in the past, please send them to us via email scavlist@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe scavenger hunt list is open to interpretation and we are not responsible for how list items are interpreted. We have had a number of pre-teens and teenagers play the scavenger hunt over the years, primarily with their parents but occasionally alone. The team that won at DC24 included a teenager with their parents. Parental Guidance Recommended.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1691289780,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"timeband_id":990,"links":[{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/245255"},{"label":"Twitter (@defconscavhunt)","type":"link","url":"https://twitter.com/@defconscavhunt"},{"label":"Discord","type":"link","url":"https://discord.com/channels/708208267699945503/711049278163779605"}],"end":"2023-08-12T01:00:00.000-0000","id":51459,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45635,45646,45743,45763],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691773200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45719,"name":"Caesars Forum - Summit - Contest Area","hotel":"","short_name":"Summit - Contest Area","id":45855},"spans_timebands":"N","updated":"2023-08-06T02:43:00.000-0000","begin":"2023-08-11T17:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"The DEF CON Kubernetes Capture the Flag (CTF) contest features a Kubernetes-based CTF challenge, where teams and individuals can build and test their Kubernetes hacking skills.

Enter the code into the vending machine and a badge will be dispensed to you! There are a variety of challenges to earn a badge, as well as challenges to continue working on the badge itself once obtained. These span from hardware hacking, reverse engineering, OSINT, OS & network security to name a few. Hardware hacking is our passion and we want people to learn on badges. But more importantly, there is a lot to learn at DEF CON, so our challenge will hopefully serve a desire to learn something new and meet new friends while trying to earn a badge and hack it further. We hope you enjoy 5n4ck3y and all that it has to offer!","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1691802000,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1690142100,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"timeband_id":990,"links":[{"label":"Twitter","type":"link","url":"https://twitter.com/ANDnXOR"},{"label":"Discuss (DEF CON Forums)","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/245450"}],"end":"2023-08-12T01:00:00.000-0000","id":51425,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691773200,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[45635,45646,45743],"village_id":null,"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45719,"name":"Caesars Forum - Summit - Contest Area","hotel":"","short_name":"Summit - Contest Area","id":45855},"begin":"2023-08-11T17:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-07-23T19:55:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Are you ready to put your problem-solving skills to the test?\r\n\r\nThis year, we are proud to introduce a brand new contest, designed to push your limits and awaken your curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe ?

If you guessed 20 years old, you’d be wrong! It’s been around since 1997 when it was first released in Phrack magazine.

Changing Nmap from a simple port scanner to the swiss army knife of network scanners.

If you’ve ever wondered how people write Nmap scripts, what it would take to write your own and how you can use them, this workshop is for you.\r\n\r\nAttendees in this workshop will learn how to understand and update the Nmap probe file, how to write Lua scripts (which Nmap scripting uses), how to write Nmap scripts to supplement the probe file, interact with custom services and ultimately write multiple Nmap scripts to do fun stuff with ports. Once attendees have a firm grasp of the Nmap scripting engine they will be introduced to writing Nmap libraries for use by their various scripts. This workshop contains many instructor lead labs so that attendees can see their code in action. To make this workshop worthwhile, a custom service running on a port has been created which the labs will allow you to probe and identify as the course goes on.\r\n\r\nNmap is the workhorse behind the scenes for so many pentesters, but the resources for writing scripts are limited.

To make this workshop worthwhile, a custom service running on a port has been created which the labs will allow you to probe and identify as the course goes on.\r\n\r\nNmap is the workhorse behind the scenes for so many pentesters, but the resources for writing scripts are limited. The hope is that by offering this workshop, more people will be able to write Nmap scripts for the betterment of all hackingkind.\r\n\r\nSkill Level: Beginner\r\n\r\nPrerequisites for students: \r\n- Some basic understanding of how to write code (python, C, Lua, etc), how to use the Linux command line.\r\n\r\nMaterials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate: \r\n- A laptop capable of running a linux VM","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1688055120,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[50625],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50733],"name":"Philip Young \"Soldier of FORTRAN\"","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":49876}],"timeband_id":989,"end":"2023-08-11T01:00:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Registration","type":"link","url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/phil-young-improving-nmap-by-writing-new-scripts-and-libraries-tickets-668361767037?aff=oddtdtcreator"}],"id":50733,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45634,45652,45743,45877],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691701200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49876}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45665,"name":"Flamingo - Exec Conf Ctr - Foyer - Workshop Checkin","hotel":"","short_name":"Foyer - Workshop Checkin","id":45755},"begin":"2023-08-10T21:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-06-29T16:12:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"DotNet based malware originally started out as a novelty, but has shown it is here to stay.

The future of hacking, cybersecurity, and human rights are at risk as the United Nations negotiates a draft UN cybercrime treaty that has the potential to substantively reshape anti-hacking law around the world. The proposed Treaty could change the game for security researchers and coders like you.

Students must be able to write basic Python scripts, and have a working knowledge of the Windows OS. Familiarity with Windows malware, assembly, and debugging are strongly recommended. If you have opened malware in a debugger before you will feel right at home here.\r\n\r\nYou will be provided with detailed virtual machine setup instructions prior to the workshop. Please make sure to bring a laptop that meets the following requirements.\r\n\r\n- Your laptop must have VirtualBox or VMWare installed and working prior to the start of the course.\r\n- Your laptop must have at least 60GB of disk space free.\r\n- Your laptop must also be able to mount USB storage devices. (Make sure you have the appropriate dongle if you need one.)\r\n\r\nSkill Level: Intermediate\r\n\r\nPrerequisites for students: \r\n- Students must be able to write basic Python scripts and have a basic understanding of the Windows operating system.\r\n- Familiarity with a Windows malware, debugging, and assembly would also be a significant benefit.\r\n\r\nMaterials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate:\r\n- Students must bring a laptop capable of running a Windows virtual machine with the following configuration. Time will be given to troubleshoot lab setup issues but it is strongly recommended that students have the following setup prior to the workshop.\r\n\r\n[Host Setup]\r\n- The laptop must have VirtualBox or VMWare installed and working prior to class.\r\n- The laptop must have at least 60GB of disk space free.\r\n- The laptop must be able to mount USB storage devices (ensure you have the appropriate dongle if you need one).\r\n\r\n[ VM Install ]\r\n- Download a free Windows 11 VM from Microsoft (https://developer.microsoft.com/en-u...tual-machines/)\r\n- You can also use a Windows VM of your choice (Windows 10 is also ok)\r\n\r\n[ VM Install for Mac - Apple Silicon Only (M1, M2)]\r\n- If you have a new Apple Silicon MacBook you will are limited to running an ARM Windows VM\r\n- ARM Windows VMs are suitable for the workshop and you can follow our installation guide on YouTube (https://youtu.be/0eR8yrDLV5M)\r\n\r\n[VM Setup]\r\n- Install x64dbg in your VM (https://x64dbg.com/)\r\n- Install a free version of IDA in your VM (https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/)\r\n- Install a version of Python > 3.8.x in your VM (https://www.python.org/)","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1688054340,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[50620],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50728],"name":"Sergei Frankoff","affiliations":[{"organization":"OpenAnalysis Inc","title":"Co-founder"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":49868,"title":"Co-founder at OpenAnalysis Inc"},{"content_ids":[50620],"conference_id":96,"event_ids":[50728],"name":"Sean Wilson","affiliations":[{"organization":"OpenAnalysis Inc","title":"Co-Founder"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":49869,"title":"Co-Founder at OpenAnalysis Inc"}],"timeband_id":989,"end":"2023-08-10T20:00:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Registration","type":"link","url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sergei-frankoff-a-practical-approach-to-emulating-malware-tickets-668358156237?aff=oddtdtcreator"}],"id":50728,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45634,45654,45743,45877],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1691683200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49869},{"tag_id":45590,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49868}],"tags":"","conference_id":96,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":96,"conference":"DEFCON31","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:38+0000","parent_id":45665,"name":"Flamingo - Exec Conf Ctr - Foyer - Workshop Checkin","hotel":"","short_name":"Foyer - Workshop Checkin","id":45755},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2023-08-10T16:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-06-29T15:59:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON31","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Cloud providers' ecosystems have brought a lot of new challenges to companies and Security teams.
