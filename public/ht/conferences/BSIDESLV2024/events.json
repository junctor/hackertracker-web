While you might not be ready to implement this today, you will walk away from this session with a sense of how to better approach secrets security for the future.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720981320,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[55020],"conference_id":150,"event_ids":[55395],"name":"Dwayne McDaniel","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54607}],"timeband_id":1191,"links":[],"end":"2024-08-08T00:45:00.000-0000","id":55395,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[46670,46682],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723075200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46607,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54607}],"tags":"","conference_id":150,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"Tuscany","hotel":"","short_name":"Tuscany","id":46432},"begin":"2024-08-08T00:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-14T18:22:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESLV2024","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Detecting multi-stage cyber attacks is challenging as incidents are often disjointed and hidden among noise.

Many real-world examples are provided, with slides that use an entertaining style including Lego brick models, self-drawn cartoons, and animations.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720981320,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[55019],"conference_id":150,"event_ids":[55394],"name":"Klaus Schmeh","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54620},{"content_ids":[55019],"conference_id":150,"event_ids":[55394],"name":"Elonka Dunin","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54638}],"timeband_id":1191,"links":[],"end":"2024-08-07T22:45:00.000-0000","id":55394,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[46670,46682],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723068000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46607,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54638},{"tag_id":46607,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54620}],"tags":"","conference_id":150,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"Tuscany","hotel":"","short_name":"Tuscany","id":46432},"begin":"2024-08-07T22:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-14T18:22:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESLV2024","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Every day, we hear about large language models (LLMs) enabling adversaries to launch low-cost, high-volume attacks.

The recent years have seen major supply chain attacks such as Log4j and Solarwinds which have urged governments and industries to rethink their defenses and incorporate strong security measures. One key strategy which has gained significant attention is SBOM - “Software Bill of Materials”. The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) defines SBOMs as a “nested inventory, a list of ingredients that make up software components” and further calls it “a key building block in software security and software supply chain risk management”. An SBOM lists all of components and software dependencies used right from developing an application to its delivery. It serves as a record to keep track of third-party component usage in an organization.

The recent years have seen major supply chain attacks such as Log4j and Solarwinds which have urged governments and industries to rethink their defenses and incorporate strong security measures. One key strategy which has gained significant attention is SBOM - “Software Bill of Materials”. The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) defines SBOMs as a “nested inventory, a list of ingredients that make up software components” and further calls it “a key building block in software security and software supply chain risk management”. An SBOM lists all of components and software dependencies used right from developing an application to its delivery. It serves as a record to keep track of third-party component usage in an organization. Some may recognise this as similar to a traditional bill of materials (BOM) used in the supply chain and manufacturing industry.

I will also share case studies of significant cloud vulnerabilities that could have been prevented with this guardrail.\r\n\r\nThe next part of the talk will dive deep into the FlowFixation vulnerability, that affected AWS Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA), enabling attackers to hijack a user session and potentially execute remote code (RCE) on underlying instances.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720981320,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54910],"conference_id":150,"event_ids":[55319],"name":"Liv Matan","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54542}],"timeband_id":1190,"links":[],"end":"2024-08-06T22:20:00.000-0000","id":55319,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[46660,46681],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1722981600,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46607,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54542}],"tags":"","conference_id":150,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"Florentine A","hotel":"","short_name":"Florentine A","id":46441},"begin":"2024-08-06T22:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-14T18:22:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESLV2024","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"This workshop will teach you how to deploy Rogue APs in your client's environment.
