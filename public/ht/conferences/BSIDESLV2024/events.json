Even if you haven't embraced modern CFML, ColdFusion remains a common legacy application platform found in organizations of all sizes and verticals.  In this talk we'll look at a series of ColdFusion vulnerabilities, map out the attack surface of modern ColdFusion environments, and consider some approaches for attack surface reduction.  So whether you consider ColdFusion to be a modern JVM scripting language, legacy application tech debt, or an easy pentest  win,  this talk is for you.  And if you're too cool for ColdFusion, just squint and pretend it's a Java talk.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720981360,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54882],"conference_id":150,"event_ids":[55294],"name":"Brian Reilly","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54652}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-08T00:00:00Z","timeband_id":1191,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-14T18:22:40Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-08T00:45:00.000-0000","id":55294,"tag_ids":[46660,46682],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1723075200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46607,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54652}],"tags":"","conference_id":150,"location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"Florentine A","hotel":"","short_name":"Florentine A","id":46441},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-08T00:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-14T18:22:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESLV2024","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Multiple US agencies (and Canada too) have confirmed that Volt Typhoon has compromised the IT environments of multiple critical infrastructure organizations—primarily in Communications, Energy, Transportation Systems, and Water and Wastewater Systems Sectors—in the continental and non-continental United States and its territories, including Guam.

We provide the fixed telecommunication services to our 13 million+ customers as the largest telecom carrier in Japan.

Additionally, to evaluate our method, we applied our SSVC method to over 50,000 relevant vulnerabilities published over the past few years based on the software components information from our actual hundreds of services.\r\n\r\nIn the evaluation result, the total number of “Immediate” vulnerabilities is 8% which is much more realistic than responding to all. The results also show that the method effectively prioritize the vulnerabilities considering attack possibility, open/closed network, business impact, etc.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will describe what issues we faced, the problem of CVSS and how we decided to adopt SSVC. We will share about our SSVC method, its benefits, evaluation results, and how to use the method.

Additionally, to evaluate our method, we applied our SSVC method to over 50,000 relevant vulnerabilities published over the past few years based on the software components information from our actual hundreds of services.\r\n\r\nIn the evaluation result, the total number of “Immediate” vulnerabilities is 8% which is much more realistic than responding to all. The results also show that the method effectively prioritize the vulnerabilities considering attack possibility, open/closed network, business impact, etc.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will describe what issues we faced, the problem of CVSS and how we decided to adopt SSVC. We will share about our SSVC method, its benefits, evaluation results, and how to use the method. We hope this presentation will help you with your practical vulnerability management.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722305703,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[55514],"conference_id":150,"event_ids":[55959],"name":"Hirofumi Kawauchi","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":56030}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-07T01:30:00Z","timeband_id":1190,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-30T02:15:03Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-07T01:50:00.000-0000","id":55959,"tag_ids":[46664,46681],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1722994200,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46607,"sort_order":1,"person_id":56030}],"tags":"","conference_id":150,"location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"Siena","hotel":"","short_name":"Siena","id":46427},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-07T01:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-30T02:15:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESLV2024","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"CVE Hunting: Wi-Fi Routers, OSINT & 'The Tyranny of the Default', is a first hand account of CVE Hunting techniques that initially stemmed from a common issue in Cybersecurity: The use of default credentials.

Additionally, even just going through the exercise can teach valuable lessons about system failure points and design weaknesses, which can better inform incident response.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720981360,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54878],"conference_id":150,"event_ids":[55292],"name":"Kenton McDonough","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54578}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-06T22:00:00Z","timeband_id":1190,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-14T18:22:40Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-06T22:45:00.000-0000","id":55292,"tag_ids":[46670,46682],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1722981600,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46607,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54578}],"tags":"","conference_id":150,"location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"Tuscany","hotel":"","short_name":"Tuscany","id":46432},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-06T22:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-14T18:22:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESLV2024","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"When building software integrations, developers face important decisions that are influenced by time, budget, and the technologies they know and sometimes these decisions can lead to security vulnerabilities.

For experiment number 2, we were able to describe Mirai infection patterns, the commands that are executed upon infection and the most active countries providing infrastructure for botnet payload propagation.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720981360,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54864],"conference_id":150,"event_ids":[55281],"name":"Fabricio Bortoluzzi","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54560}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-06T21:00:00Z","timeband_id":1190,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-14T18:22:40Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-06T21:45:00.000-0000","id":55281,"tag_ids":[46660,46682],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1722978000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46607,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54560}],"tags":"","conference_id":150,"location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"Florentine A","hotel":"","short_name":"Florentine A","id":46441},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-06T21:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-14T18:22:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESLV2024","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Conversations with recruiters are always challenging, intimidating, and sometimes infuriating.

We further hypothesize that the digital footprint cleaner and personalized spam filters will result in tangible security improvements at a minimal cost.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720981360,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54943,55014],"conference_id":150,"event_ids":[55341,55390],"name":"arun vishwanath","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54502},{"content_ids":[54943],"conference_id":150,"event_ids":[55341],"name":"Fred Heiding","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54525},{"content_ids":[54943],"conference_id":150,"event_ids":[55341],"name":"Simon Lermen","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54659}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-06T18:30:00Z","timeband_id":1190,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-14T18:22:40Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-06T19:15:00.000-0000","id":55341,"tag_ids":[46664,46682],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1722969000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46607,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54525},{"tag_id":46607,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54659},{"tag_id":46607,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54502}],"tags":"","conference_id":150,"location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"Siena","hotel":"","short_name":"Siena","id":46427},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-06T18:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-14T18:22:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESLV2024","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"In this talk, we delve into the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats in cloud environments, showcasing how adversaries are shifting tactics from traditional breaches to sophisticated cloud-specific attacks.

This abstract outlines the vulnerability's technical details, impact, and mitigation strategies, underscoring the critical need for robust security measures in Kubernetes environments utilizing GitOps.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720981360,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54912],"conference_id":150,"event_ids":[55321],"name":"Oreen Livni Shein","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54509},{"content_ids":[54912],"conference_id":150,"event_ids":[55321],"name":"Elad Pticha","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54587}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-06T17:30:00Z","timeband_id":1190,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-14T18:22:40Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-06T18:25:00.000-0000","id":55321,"tag_ids":[46660,46682],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1722965400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46607,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54587},{"tag_id":46607,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54509}],"tags":"","conference_id":150,"location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"Florentine A","hotel":"","short_name":"Florentine A","id":46441},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-06T17:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-14T18:22:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESLV2024","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Richard Brason is oft quoted with the quip that the quickest way to become a millionaire in the Airline Industry is to start as a billionaire.

I’m a threat analyst for a cyber research group.\r\n\r\nSo, let me show you how you, too, can pivot into information security during this 4-hour RPG tabletop campaign-workshop! \r\n\r\nI’ll guide participant-players through a modern infosec hiring process RPG tabletop “campaign” workshop, acting as the game master as participant-players reskill their classes and adjust their application strategies to win a coveted role for their infosec party.\r\n\r\nIn the end, you’ll walk away with concrete research, tools, and techniques to help your next employer properly value and respect your current non-infosec skills and experience in your first infosec role.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1720981360,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[54889,54956],"conference_id":150,"event_ids":[55258,55265],"name":"Stryker","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":54559}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-06T17:30:00Z","timeband_id":1190,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-14T18:22:40Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-06T21:30:00.000-0000","id":55258,"tag_ids":[46673,46683],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1722965400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46607,"sort_order":1,"person_id":54559}],"tags":"","conference_id":150,"location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"Boardroom","hotel":"","short_name":"Boardroom","id":46436},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-06T17:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-14T18:22:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESLV2024","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Several times in my career, I took a job that was new, and often, on a new team at a young organization.
