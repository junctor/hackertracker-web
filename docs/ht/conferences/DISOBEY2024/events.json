However, these powerful technologies also pose significant challenges and risks for social justice and society, as they can be used to create and spread disinformation, manipulate public opinion, infringe on personal privacy, and undermine trust in institutions and information sources. A single additional like to a Facebook page that disseminates fake news leads, on average, to an electoral gain of 0.145 votes for populist parties. In this talk, we will explore some of these current and emerging threats of generative AI, as well as some of the possible solutions and countermeasures.\r\nMaria will present the latest research and data on how LLMs are being used to generate and disseminate fake news, propaganda, and misinformation, and how this affects the political landscape and the democratic process. She will also examine how LLMs and AI are eroding our privacy at work, by analyzing how employers and security teams are using AI for surveillance, profiling of individuals, for the sake of corporate defense.\r\n\r\nDimitri will illustrate some of the practical examples of AI misuse and abuse, such as deep fakes, synthetic identities, phishing, and cyberattacks, and how they can harm individuals and organizations. He will also discuss how AI APIs are becoming the root of all evil, by enabling anyone with minimal technical skills and malicious intentions to access and exploit powerful generative AI models and services. He will discuss some of the ethical and legal frameworks and guidelines that are needed to regulate and monitor the use of generative AI, and to protect the rights and interests of the users and the society.\n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are significantly transforming the way we work. Within cybersecurity, professionals and researchers have identified an arms race: LLM-based tactics for both offense and defense trying to outpace each other. Companies mainly worry about their Intellectual Property being used to train these models. But,  \r\npersonal data is increasingly used to train data sets, and privacy authorities are starting - or should definitely start -  to worry about this.

Further, I hope it can bring a fresh perspective on how we understand motivation and community in the context of security, as well as how the global situation might unfold.\n\n\nWith the rise of AI we look for tools to deal with security risks caused by deception, gullibility and the human factor. Ken Wilber’s Integral Theory is a holistic framework on human, societal and cultural development that provides one of the most comprehensive toolkits for understanding motivation and change. I will present the main tenets of the theory and suggest ways how security professionals and the hacker community can benefit from these insights.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1707886260,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"conference_id":134,"event_ids":[54121],"name":"Sami Kivelä","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":53254}],"timeband_id":1151,"links":[],"end":"2024-02-17T10:30:00.000-0000","id":54121,"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1708164000,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[46191,46198],"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46179,"sort_order":1,"person_id":53254}],"tags":"","conference_id":134,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":134,"conference":"DISOBEY2024","updated_at":"2024-02-16T15:42+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"Security Theater","hotel":"","short_name":"Security Theater","id":46184},"spans_timebands":"N","updated":"2024-02-14T04:51:00.000-0000","begin":"2024-02-17T10:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DISOBEY2024","timezone":"Europe/Helsinki","link":"","description":"What happens when a malware infects a machine?

We will explore how ANSI escape sequences can be used to inject, vandalize, and even weaponize plaintext logfiles of modern applications.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1707886260,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"conference_id":134,"event_ids":[54117],"name":"STÖK","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":52632}],"timeband_id":1150,"links":[],"end":"2024-02-16T19:15:00.000-0000","id":54117,"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1708107300,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[46192,46199],"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46179,"sort_order":1,"person_id":52632}],"tags":"","conference_id":134,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":134,"conference":"DISOBEY2024","updated_at":"2024-02-16T15:42+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"Main Stage","hotel":"","short_name":"Main Stage","id":46183},"begin":"2024-02-16T18:15:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-02-14T04:51:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DISOBEY2024","timezone":"Europe/Helsinki","link":"","description":"Detailed Outline:\r\n\r\n1.

This is a story who are cl0p, who were their targets, and how they managed to steal your data.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1708098000,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"conference_id":134,"event_ids":[54150],"name":"Juho \"whois\" Jauhiainen","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":53471}],"timeband_id":1150,"links":[],"end":"2024-02-16T15:45:00.000-0000","id":54150,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1708095600,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[46191,46198],"village_id":null,"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46179,"sort_order":1,"person_id":53471}],"tags":"","conference_id":134,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":134,"conference":"DISOBEY2024","updated_at":"2024-02-16T15:42+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"Main Stage","hotel":"","short_name":"Main Stage","id":46183},"updated":"2024-02-16T15:40:00.000-0000","begin":"2024-02-16T15:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DISOBEY2024","timezone":"Europe/Helsinki","link":"","description":"Project Lead Viivi Lehtinen and inspector Aki Somerkallio from Cybercrime Centre at the\r\nNational Bureau of Investigation run an early intervention project called Cybercrime Exit\r\nwhich is part of the special preventive operations of the Police.

Presenter has tried several different approaches, some has failed, some succeeded and wants to share his own best-practises with the wider community. After this presentation hopefully there will be some folks who will continue the HW-journey on their own with some new approaches and ideas. We'll be talking about non-soldering/soldering approaches, nrf5340DK boards, lifting firmwares, debugging on hardware itself and which methods has been found useful and which definetly not. Presentation also includes a real-life example of taking back control of your very own home router!\n\n\nHW-hacking all the things, tips and tricks with a budget! The presentation aims to raise awareness of HW-hacking among hackers and common people. Share some backgrounds from electronics manufacturing, testing phases, development and other included processes . Also, the idea is to show how to possibly lift firmware from range of devices and offer an easy'ish solution to build your boot camp for HW-hacking.

Presenter has tried several different approaches, some has failed, some succeeded and wants to share his own best-practises with the wider community. After this presentation hopefully there will be some folks who will continue the HW-journey on their own with some new approaches and ideas. We'll be talking about non-soldering/soldering approaches, nrf5340DK boards, lifting firmwares, debugging on hardware itself and which methods has been found useful and which definetly not. Presentation also includes a real-life example of taking back control of your very own home router!\n\n\nHW-hacking all the things, tips and tricks with a budget! The presentation aims to raise awareness of HW-hacking among hackers and common people.
