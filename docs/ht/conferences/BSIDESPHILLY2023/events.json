We need to be judicious about where we are getting our information from and how we are handling that information, especially if it was relayed to us in a trusted capacity.\r\n\r\nFrom a threat intelligence perspective, we develop expertise for finding sources on a particular set of topics, identifying primary and derivative source materials, detecting circular reporting, corroborating information, and detecting if sources are providing false or misleading information - or disinformation. The confidence we have in our assessments about threats and incidents directly hinges on the quality of our sources, the information provided to us, and unanswered questions and assumptions. Threat intelligence also employs handling frameworks so we can exchange information with a number of internal and external groups. Trust is central to this process, and we need to be selective about which sources we trust as well as be responsible stewards of information entrusted to us.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will walk through the following to provide attendees with practical guidance and real world examples so they can develop and widen their pool of trusted sources and enhance internal processes for identifying, refining, integrating, analyzing, and sharing information:\r\n- Managing expectations when issues are circulating in the media and online;\r\n- Knowing, trusting, and working with sources, information, and intelligence;\r\n- Identifying new sources to address collection gaps;\r\n- Prioritizing sources based on intelligence requirements;\r\n- Evaluating and validating sources for credibility, accuracy, corroboration, circular reporting, and deception; and,\r\n- Handling information per traffic light protocol (TLP) standards to maintain trusted relationships.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1702061400,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1701882000,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"conference_id":130,"event_ids":[53401],"name":"Sierra Stanczyk","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":52234}],"timeband_id":1139,"links":[],"end":"2023-12-08T18:50:00.000-0000","id":53401,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[46093],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1702058400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46094,"sort_order":1,"person_id":52234}],"tags":"","conference_id":130,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":130,"conference":"BSIDESPHILLY2023","updated_at":"2023-12-07T00:56+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"Track 2","hotel":"","short_name":"Track 2","id":46123},"begin":"2023-12-08T18:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-12-06T17:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESPHILLY2023","timezone":"America/New_York","link":"","description":"Multidisciplinary artist based from Philadelphia, working at the intersection of sound and visuals.
