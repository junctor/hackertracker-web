Without knowing how exactly a hacker can crack your password, it can be difficult to take steps to protect yourself from bad actors. A survey from the Digital Guardian mentioned that about 50% of participants reuse passwords. It also stated that 32.8% did not know what two-factor authentication was, 38.6% write their password on a sticky note, and 16.1% store their password in a file. With great power comes great responsibility, and this applies to user password practices. Passwords are the #1 desired data type by hackers, and personal data is ranked #2 according to the 2021 Verizon Data Breach Report. Additionally, 89% of web application breaches involved credential abuse. In this talk, we will go over how a hacker can use seemingly benign information to customize their attack on a victim by showing a scenario-based attack and demo (using free and open-source tools).

I hope to show you the 'state of the art' in offensive ML and where people like yourself can have the most impact.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1713025800,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1712784240,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"conference_id":135,"event_ids":[54194],"name":"Adrian Wood (threlfall)","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[{"hash_sha256":"bd3f6962c13c14c964197e1df271dbcd8ce16341737c2457c9c882e6e0c35c32","filetype":"image/webp","hash_md5":"2762814710df7e8b25cfaf014ad5a4b2","name":"adrian-wood.webp","hash_crc32c":"77a2dc77","asset_id":474,"filesize":116382,"sort_order":1,"url":"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hackertest-5a202.appspot.com/o/BSIDESPR2024%2Fadrian-wood.webp?alt=media","person_id":53502}],"id":53502}],"timeband_id":1153,"links":[],"end":"2024-04-13T16:30:00.000-0000","id":54194,"tag_ids":[46203],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1713022200,"nanoseconds":0},"village_id":null,"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46204,"sort_order":1,"person_id":53502}],"tags":"","conference_id":135,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":135,"conference":"BSIDESPR2024","updated_at":"2024-04-10T21:48+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"Main Hall 104B-104C","hotel":"","short_name":"Main Hall 104B-104C","id":46186},"begin":"2024-04-13T15:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-04-10T21:24:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESPR2024","timezone":"America/Puerto_Rico","link":"","description":"In today's era, the rise of automated cyber threats targeting open internet ports calls for a nuanced security approach.

This proposal will shed light on the security issues surrounding fax machines in healthcare settings, discuss why hospitals still employ them, and explore the barriers they create for patients. We will also delve into the technical considerations and present alternative, secure communication methods. The persistence of fax machines in a healthcare setting can be attributed to historical norms and regulatory compliance. They are perceived as a secure means of transmitting sensitive patient information, though the reality is quite the opposite. Moreover, since faxes often sit in open communal areas, the risk of physical document theft is significant. The lack of encryption and secure authentication mechanisms further compounds these issues, potentially leading to patient data breaches. In 2019, a major healthcare provider in the U.S. inadvertently exposed 1.7 million patient records due to a fax server misconfiguration, illustrating the critical risks involved. Requiring patients to send records via fax creates a significant barrier to care, especially for those who lack access to fax machines or the technical know-how to use them. Patients, often already burdened with health concerns, face unnecessary hurdles in their healthcare journey. Real-life cases demonstrate how this can lead to delayed diagnoses, missed appointments, and suboptimal patient outcomes. The transition from traditional faxing to secure electronic communication methods in healthcare is a transformation that not only provides substantial business value and enhanced security but also brings pivotal improvements in patient care and outcomes. Secure messaging platforms, EHR integration, telemedicine solutions, and Health Information Exchange (HIE) messaging offer highly protected channels for sharing patient data. These alternatives streamline communication and enhance operational efficiency, ultimately leading to faster and more informed decision-making, which, in turn, improves patient care. The estimated benefits encompass cost savings, better resource utilization, and revenue growth, while simultaneously reducing the risk of data breaches and non-compliance with regulations such as HIPAA. Administrative changes like user training, access control, consent management, and compliance measures are instrumental in reaping these advantages. This presentation will highlight how adopting these direct alternatives to legacy fax policies, healthcare organizations can fortify data protection, optimize workflows, and ensure their continued success and growth while also contributing to better patient care and outcomes.\n\n\n","title":"The Fax and the Furious: A Prescription for Modern Healthcare Data Exchange","type":{"conference_id":135,"conference":"BSIDESPR2024","color":"#19A8B0","updated_at":"2024-04-10T21:48+0000","name":"Talk","id":46203},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1713019200,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"In the era of digital healthcare transformation, the continued use of fax machines in hospitals presents significant security challenges, especially when handling patient records and scheduling appointments for MRIs.

Addressing the threat of ransomware presents significant challenges to organizations across various sectors. Organizations can track their ransomware resilience capabilities by mapping in-use compliance frameworks to ransomware mitigation; this process requires examining the differentiators in the levity of their respective controls. Furthermore, organizations need to analyze what insurance companies are asking – their questionnaires are meant to quantify their risk and one of their largest risks is ransomware. Lastly, the development of ransomware resilience aligns with identifying single points of failure, their compensating controls, and establishing effective testing metrics that align key controls with compliance requirements. Leveraging a Security Operations Center (SOC) to fortify ransomware resilience starts with enhancing SOC visibility and awareness. Utilizing a top-down approach to security governance, the SOC should maintain points of contact across departments and establish escalation criteria for specific types of incidents, including ransomware or precursors to ransomware. SOC communication and awareness of other departments allows for improved prioritization and hardening of specific users and/or systems, particularly in the context of insider threats. A SOC can make its largest impact on the augmentation of ransomware resilience through the use of proactive intelligence and reactive testing. Threat intelligence feeds allow a SOC to gain a better understanding of who might be targeting their infrastructure, and what TTPs they are likely to use. This data should inform organizational detection and response capabilities. Threat hunting can utilize threat intelligence based on historical attack patterns, or prevalent vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild. The SOC is informed on what to hunt for based on attack patterns being seen and alerts being responded to. When carried out strategically, these hunts can be used to obtain further threat intelligence, and in turn improve detection and response capabilities. Validate detection and response capabilities with purple team testing. The concept of a purple team emerges from the integration of red and blue team activities, focusing on bridging the gap between offensive and defensive cybersecurity practices. Specifically, purple team exercises can ensure that specific activities, usually based on real threat actors, are being alerted on and the alerts are triggered correctly within the proper amount of time. Lastly, it is imperative that a SOC is a stakeholder in the organization’s communicated and tested incident response plan.
