This is a valid feeling and almost everyone goes through this while starting out or switching to a new career. \r\n\r\nThe pursuit of a fulfilling and purpose-driven career in cybersecurity goes beyond technical expertise alone. It requires a deep understanding of oneself, an exploration of individual technical and business strengths, personal passions and the ability to align personal values with the broader mission of securing the digital realm. \r\n\r\nBy understanding ourselves better, we can pinpoint areas where our passions and innate talents intersect with the vast opportunities in the field.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will be sharing my experiences of starting in a technical cybersecurity role before leveraging these technical skills to explore various business roles in cybersecurity that turned out to be a better fit. \r\n\r\nOver the last decade, I've become convinced of the importance and benefit that communities bring. In the process of seeking my own sweet spot, I started my podcast and benefited so much from hearing other people's stories about the joys and pitfalls of navigating a cybersecurity career. \r\n\r\nShared storytelling is a scalable community building strategy everyone one can benefit from as they find the right role for themselves within cybersecurity.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722458703,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[55744],"conference_id":151,"event_ids":[56267],"name":"Shruthi Kamath","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":56134}],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-05T21:30:00Z","timeband_id":1192,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-31T20:45:03Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-05T21:50:00.000-0000","id":56267,"tag_ids":[46634],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1722893400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46621,"sort_order":1,"person_id":56134}],"tags":"","conference_id":151,"location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"Track 1 (Palo Verde A)","hotel":"","short_name":"Track 1 (Palo Verde A)","id":46410},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-05T21:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-31T20:45:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"TDI2024","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"","title":"Ethical AI","type":{"conference_id":151,"conference":"TDI2024","updated_at":"2024-08-02T21:24+0000","color":"#14a25a","name":"Career Village Talk","updated_tsz":"2024-08-02T21:24:35Z","id":46828},"end_tsz":"2024-08-05T21:50:00Z","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1722894600,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1722458703,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"begin_tsz":"2024-08-05T21:30:00Z","timeband_id":1192,"updated_tsz":"2024-07-31T20:45:03Z","links":[],"end":"2024-08-05T21:50:00.000-0000","id":55895,"tag_ids":[46828],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1722893400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":151,"location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"Career Village (Willow)","hotel":"","short_name":"Career Village (Willow)","id":46454},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-08-05T21:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-07-31T20:45:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"TDI2024","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Over the past few months, I had the opportunity to witness Series C security startup, Semgrep, navigate its SOC 2 certification.
