Hackers continue to exploit human psychology and trust, making it imperative for cybersecurity professionals to explore innovative approaches to enhance awareness and resilience. This presentation at B Sides, the Cyber Security Nonprofit, delves into an unconventional yet highly effective strategy: using comedy as a social engineering methodology.\r\n\r\nHumor has an extraordinary power to engage, disarm, and educate. By strategically incorporating elements of comedy into cybersecurity awareness programs and training, organizations can empower their employees to recognize and thwart social engineering attempts more effectively.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1699126200,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1698961800,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"conference_id":129,"event_ids":[53386],"name":"Frankie Benz","affiliations":[],"links":[{"description":"","title":"Instagram","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.instagram.com/frankiedoescomedy/"}],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":52195}],"timeband_id":1138,"links":[],"end":"2023-11-04T19:30:00.000-0000","id":53386,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1699122600,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[46079],"village_id":null,"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46080,"sort_order":1,"person_id":52195}],"tags":"","conference_id":129,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":129,"conference":"BSIDESDFW2023","updated_at":"2023-11-02T22:02+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"Track 3","hotel":"","short_name":"Track 3","id":46118},"spans_timebands":"N","updated":"2023-11-02T21:50:00.000-0000","begin":"2023-11-04T18:30:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESDFW2023","timezone":"America/Chicago","link":"","description":"Over the last year and a half my team has worked closely with our Blue Team to improve various network and endpoint detection.
