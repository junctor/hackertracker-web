Most importantly it will cover defensive techniques and focus on the bottlenecks defenders can monitor to detect this activity. \r\n\r\nTake-aways: The attendees with walk away with access to a repo with logs containing activity from the discussed persistence mechanisms along with detection logic.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1708191000,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1708180200,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"conference_id":132,"event_ids":[54046],"name":"Ryan Thompson","affiliations":[],"links":[{"description":null,"title":"Blog","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.checksomebytes.com"}],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":52621}],"timeband_id":1145,"links":[],"end":"2024-02-17T17:30:00.000-0000","id":54046,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1708187400,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[46155,46159,46163],"village_id":null,"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46143,"sort_order":1,"person_id":52621}],"tags":"","conference_id":132,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":132,"conference":"CACTUSCON2024","updated_at":"2024-02-17T14:48+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"Track 1","hotel":"","short_name":"Track 1","id":46173},"updated":"2024-02-17T14:30:00.000-0000","begin":"2024-02-17T16:30:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"CACTUSCON2024","timezone":"America/Denver","link":"","description":"","type":{"conference_id":132,"conference":"CACTUSCON2024","updated_at":"2024-02-17T14:48+0000","color":"#465bbe","name":"Misc","id":46165},"title":"Registration","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1708187700,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1708180200,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"timeband_id":1145,"links":[],"end":"2024-02-17T16:35:00.000-0000","id":54045,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1708185600,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[46165],"village_id":null,"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":132,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":132,"conference":"CACTUSCON2024","updated_at":"2024-02-17T14:48+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"Track 1","hotel":"","short_name":"Track 1","id":46173},"begin":"2024-02-17T16:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-02-17T14:30:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"CACTUSCON2024","timezone":"America/Denver","link":"","description":"Sponsored by the Happy Hour Sponsor!\n\n\n","type":{"conference_id":132,"conference":"CACTUSCON2024","updated_at":"2024-02-17T14:48+0000","color":"#465bbe","name":"Misc","id":46165},"title":"Happy Hour","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1708131600,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Sponsored by the Happy Hour Sponsor!","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1708180200,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"conference_id":132,"event_ids":[54039,54044,54051,54042],"name":"Hacktar .","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":52586}],"timeband_id":1144,"links":[],"end":"2024-02-17T01:00:00.000-0000","id":54044,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1708128000,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[46165],"village_id":null,"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46143,"sort_order":1,"person_id":52586}],"tags":"","conference_id":132,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":132,"conference":"CACTUSCON2024","updated_at":"2024-02-17T14:48+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"Track 1","hotel":"","short_name":"Track 1","id":46173},"spans_timebands":"N","updated":"2024-02-17T14:30:00.000-0000","begin":"2024-02-17T00:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"CACTUSCON2024","timezone":"America/Denver","link":"","description":"Nobody wants to suck at what they do.

We’ll cover how an enterprise grade Red Team leverages Infrastructure as code with the goal of improving the security posture of the organization by spending less time doing ‘Sysadmin’ tasks and more time attacking!","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1708180200,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"conference_id":132,"event_ids":[54076],"name":"Josh Huff","affiliations":[],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":null,"title":"Sessionize","sort_order":0,"url":"https://sessionize.com/huffjosh"}],"media":[],"id":52590},{"conference_id":132,"event_ids":[54076],"name":"pr0b3r7","affiliations":[],"links":[{"description":null,"title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pimentelrobert1/"},{"description":null,"title":"Sessionize","sort_order":0,"url":"https://sessionize.com/pimentelrobert"}],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":52618},{"conference_id":132,"event_ids":[54076],"name":"slyf0x","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":52624}],"timeband_id":1144,"links":[],"end":"2024-02-16T23:00:00.000-0000","id":54076,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1708120800,"nanoseconds":0},"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[46155,46159,46162],"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46143,"sort_order":1,"person_id":52590},{"tag_id":46143,"sort_order":1,"person_id":52618},{"tag_id":46143,"sort_order":1,"person_id":52624}],"tags":"","conference_id":132,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":132,"conference":"CACTUSCON2024","updated_at":"2024-02-17T14:48+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"Track 3","hotel":"","short_name":"Track 3","id":46175},"updated":"2024-02-17T14:30:00.000-0000","begin":"2024-02-16T22:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"CACTUSCON2024","timezone":"America/Denver","link":"","description":"“Natalie Hamiilton,” a previously known phishing persona, has reemerged both with a vengeance and a power drill, as part of a never ending scam.
