In this talk we'll explore how to immerse yourself in the offensive security world to obtain this knowledge without needing to change careers or obtain additional certifications. By being more informed about offensive security, defenders are better able to recognize relevant intel, understand existing threats, and more readily discover attacker behavior. Join me as I discuss how there's more to defending than just defense, and how you can find and engage with the amazing resources that are out there waiting to be explored.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1724898603,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[56506],"conference_id":160,"event_ids":[57180],"name":"Catherine Ullman","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":56844}],"begin_tsz":"2024-09-14T18:30:00Z","timeband_id":1242,"updated_tsz":"2024-08-29T02:30:03Z","links":[],"end":"2024-09-14T19:20:00.000-0000","id":57180,"tag_ids":[46933,46978],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1726338600,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46920,"sort_order":1,"person_id":56844}],"tags":"","conference_id":160,"location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"Room 401","hotel":"","short_name":"Room 401","id":46526},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-09-14T18:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-08-29T02:30:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESATL2024","timezone":"America/New_York","link":"","description":"This talk covers identifying phishing emails, sites, the tools used to confirm if it's malicious, and how to work with various entities to have the site taken down.","media":[],"title":"Here Phishy Phishy Phish...
