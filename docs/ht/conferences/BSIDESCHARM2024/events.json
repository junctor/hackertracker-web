While infrastructure and application threats are more commonly known, models can introduce unique vulnerabilities specific to AI systems such as data poisoning, bias, adversarial attacks, and more. Developing applications around the models also has the potential to increase the attack surface with issues like insecure plugin design and indirect prompt injection.\r\nWhile more eyes have been on these issues as of late, especially with regards to Large Language Models, it's important for cybersecurity professionals to have an understanding of the unique threats presented, how they are similar or different from traditional cybersecurity, as well as where we can apply or expand on existing techniques and frameworks for defense and monitoring.\n\n\nAs we move closer towards generative AI becoming widely adopted, it’s important to understand the security implications, how they differ from more traditional cybersecurity, and where we can apply existing approaches to new systems and applications.

From the provisioning and management of privileged accounts, to determining privilege and creating efficient logging and monitoring, you’ll come away with a better understanding of how to secure IAM to protect your multicloud environment.\r\n\r\nFor those in the hacking community, having awareness of the security implications of these environments is an important part of incident response, particularly because of the recent increase in cloud-savvy threat actors.\n\n\nAs companies move beyond single-cloud migrations into multicloud, cloud-savvy threat actors continually adapt. Much of the extensive damage resulting from these breaches is compounded by the theft and abuse of highly privileged credentials. In this talk, we’ll discuss the multicloud attack surface, and walk through strategic and technical do’s and don’ts of cloud-focused IAM.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1713646200,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1712084940,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"conference_id":137,"event_ids":[54245],"name":"Christian Nicholson(GuardianCosmos)","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":53544},{"conference_id":137,"event_ids":[54245],"name":"Cassandra Young (muteki)","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":53565}],"timeband_id":1157,"links":[],"end":"2024-04-20T20:50:00.000-0000","id":54245,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1713643200,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[46247],"village_id":null,"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46233,"sort_order":1,"person_id":53565},{"tag_id":46233,"sort_order":1,"person_id":53544}],"tags":"","conference_id":137,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":137,"conference":"BSIDESCHARM2024","updated_at":"2024-04-19T16:59+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"Track 2","hotel":"","short_name":"Track 2","id":46196},"begin":"2024-04-20T20:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-04-02T19:09:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESCHARM2024","timezone":"America/New_York","link":"","description":"We will cover who can issue CVEs, how version information is tracked (inaccurately), who can assign a CVSS score (and why it can be confusing), vulnerabilities that do not get a CVE, recalculating the severity of a vulnerability (in either direction), and more!

Also, studies indicate that a small number of users create most of the losses. One study found that 4% of users cause 80% of damage. As a potential attacker or defender, you clearly want to find those most vulnerable users. The question is, how do we find those 4%? Then how do we either target those users or better secure the organization against them? Attackers, including red teams, perform spear phishing to targets without regard to levels of susceptibility. Defenders don’t differentiate the levels of controls applied to users, which results in wasteful efforts that aggravate otherwise aware users. To identify users highly susceptible to phishing attacks, a study was performed, partially funded by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, where subjects were administered a variety of psychological assessments and were then sent a series of phishing messages over several months. Based upon those phishing messages, user susceptibility was determined. Personality traits of the subjects was then compared to their level of phishing susceptibility. Two traits were indicative of phishing susceptibility; low locus of control and high levels of neuroticism as measured on the Big 5 personality test. Machine learning techniques were then applied to classify phishing susceptibility, with 100% accuracy, based on 5 personality traits: locus of control, depression, self-discipline, communications, and anxiety.

Attendees will leave this talk with a better understanding of attacker techniques to compromise Active Directory & Azure AD (Entra ID) as well as methods to best mitigate these attacks.\n\n\nWe have an Identity problem & not the kind you might think of. Attacks have shifted from perimeter to endpoints & now attackers focus on identity. This talk explores the issues with Identity security specifically Active Directory & Azure AD leading to full compromise, recent breaches (MGM), & mitigations.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1713631800,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1712084940,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"conference_id":137,"event_ids":[54243],"name":"Sean Metcalf","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":53566}],"timeband_id":1157,"links":[],"end":"2024-04-20T16:50:00.000-0000","id":54243,"tag_ids":[46247],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1713628800,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46233,"sort_order":1,"person_id":53566}],"tags":"","conference_id":137,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":137,"conference":"BSIDESCHARM2024","updated_at":"2024-04-19T16:59+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"Track 1","hotel":"","short_name":"Track 1","id":46195},"begin":"2024-04-20T16:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-04-02T19:09:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESCHARM2024","timezone":"America/New_York","link":"","description":"Although the cybersecurity conversation about generative AI tends to focus on abuses, vulnerabilities, and offensive security use cases, the technology is being rapidly incorporated both into the networks we defend, and the tools we use to do so.
