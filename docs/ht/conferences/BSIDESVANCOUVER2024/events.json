As security professionals, it helps to understand how Docker works to be able to secure our workloads. At the same time, there are a number of use cases where Docker makes our lives easier as well.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop we'll get our feet wet with Docker:\r\n\r\n- Explore the basics of Docker and how it works\r\n\r\n- Work through  a number of security-relevant use cases: exploring different OS distros, running containerized security tools, building custom images, scanning Docker images for CVEs and secrets, image structure and manual introspection.\r\n\r\nPre-requisites:\r\n\r\n- Laptop with Docker installed. Docker Desktop recommended, but Docker Engine should work too.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1712635560,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[53988,53989],"conference_id":139,"event_ids":[54323,54322],"name":"Amiran Alavidze","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"id":53622,"media":[{"hash_sha256":"04a679a2715c7dc96e870f4a7700a77cb2f1dc3dd7a29e1ee2c55e94539e8294","filetype":"image/png","hash_md5":"262115617a7cb515893e29e1e01844a6","name":"AmiranAlavidze.png","hash_crc32c":"84a6a6b1","asset_id":514,"filesize":98259,"sort_order":1,"url":"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hackertest-5a202.appspot.com/o/BSIDESVANCOUVER2024%2FAmiranAlavidze.png?alt=media","person_id":53622}]}],"timeband_id":1160,"links":[],"end":"2024-05-27T00:00:00.000-0000","id":54323,"tag_ids":[46276],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1716752700,"nanoseconds":0},"village_id":null,"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46264,"sort_order":1,"person_id":53622}],"tags":"","conference_id":139,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":139,"conference":"BSIDESVANCOUVER2024","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:42+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"Room 2250","hotel":"","short_name":"Room 2250","id":46214},"spans_timebands":"N","updated":"2024-04-09T04:06:00.000-0000","begin":"2024-05-26T19:45:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESVANCOUVER2024","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"CodeQL is an open-source static analysis tool that can be used to find vulnerabilities, anti-patterns, code smells, and other interesting patterns in your codebases.
