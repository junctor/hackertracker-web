This year, we're back to share the evolution of that work into a non-partisan nationwide election cybersecurity initiative that’s racing to beat the clock on securing political parties on both sides of the aisle ahead of the 2024 Election. Along the way, we’ll explore what happens when you try to email the DNC CISO about all of his websites being vulnerable, how the Texas Republicans keep getting hacked, and why your local party office should probably update their passwords. \r\n\r\nWe'll dive into the technologies that power this initiative, including an in-depth look at the cloud-based web monitoring and breach detection system that's discovered vulnerabilities in over 98% of political party websites. We'll demonstrate how the platform has expanded to secure not just state-level parties but also local and county-level organizations, highlighting the impact this work is having on election cybersecurity efforts nationwide.

Over the years, we've detected millions of compromised devices, bared witness to hundreds of mass Nday exploitation campaigns, and tracked hundreds of benign scanning operations. We've watched network traffic start, stop, and change due to kinetic wars, and we've built a platform trusted by thousands of organizations across the world. Operating a system of this scale brings lots of cool challenges, opportunities, and unexplainable phenomena. In this talk I'll give the origin story of GreyNoise for the first time, discuss highlights and lowlights, regale weird stories, and share the exciting path forward.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1724745604,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[56281],"conference_id":158,"event_ids":[56954],"name":"Andrew Morris","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":56666}],"begin_tsz":"2024-09-07T13:40:00Z","timeband_id":1238,"updated_tsz":"2024-08-27T08:00:04Z","links":[],"end":"2024-09-07T14:30:00.000-0000","id":56954,"tag_ids":[46954],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1725716400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46889,"sort_order":1,"person_id":56666}],"tags":"","conference_id":158,"location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"Auditorium","hotel":"","short_name":"Auditorium","id":46506},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-09-07T13:40:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-08-27T08:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESNOVA2024","timezone":"America/New_York","link":"","description":"","media":[],"title":"Opening Ceremonies","type":{"conference_id":158,"conference":"BSIDESNOVA2024","updated_at":"2024-08-26T20:17+0000","color":"#8B9D03","name":"Misc","updated_tsz":"2024-08-26T20:17:57Z","id":46954},"end_tsz":"2024-09-07T13:40:00Z","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1725716400,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1724745604,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"begin_tsz":"2024-09-07T13:25:00Z","timeband_id":1238,"updated_tsz":"2024-08-27T08:00:04Z","links":[],"end":"2024-09-07T13:40:00.000-0000","id":57127,"tag_ids":[46954],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1725715500,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":158,"location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"Auditorium","hotel":"","short_name":"Auditorium","id":46506},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-09-07T13:25:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-08-27T08:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESNOVA2024","timezone":"America/New_York","link":"","description":"\r\nAI is all around us and rapidly advancing in Cyber and other domains.\r\nCome to this hands on workshop led by AI expert Tom Bendien and his AI Coaches to broaden your understanding of the GenAI ecosystem and gain hands-on skills.\r\nThe workshop is beginner friendly while providing the opportunity for more advanced practitioners to learn new skills.\r\n\r\nPrerequisites:\r\nAll training will be web based with an email and 2FA required for login.\r\n\r\n\r\nOptional for hands on workshop requiring software installation and configuration:\r\nA BYO Windows, Linux or Mac computer is required for the hands on sessions requiring the installation of open source software.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttendees can work together in small groups to see the open source AI software in action if they do not wish to run the hands on part of the sessions themselves.\r\nA limited number of training laptops will be provided for group activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nA list of pre requisite software that must be installed on BYO computers before the workshop is shown below.\r\nWiFi Internet access will be limited, so the more prerequisite software you can install, the faster you will be able to get to work!\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow the lab shown here to prepare your BYO computer for the workshop:\r\nhttps://gtcyberlabs.org/f/local-ai-installation-quickstart\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkshop formats/options:\r\n1.

You will learn what skills are needed to participate, how to approach the challenges, and what are some of the common tools you may want to be familiar with. We will go over an example CTF as a group, and you will have a chance to work through several example CTF challenges at your own pace with unlimited hints and guidance from our volunteers. We hope that you walk away not only with some new security skills but also the confidence to participate in a CTF on your own.\r\n\r\nGet your tickets: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bsidesnova-2024-8-bit-games-sept-6-7-arlington-va-tickets-971314707437","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1724745604,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[56267,56264],"conference_id":158,"event_ids":[56937,56940],"name":"Nikola Bura","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":null,"title":"Blog","sort_order":0,"url":"https://nikolabura.com/blog"},{"description":null,"title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolabura/"}],"media":[],"id":56677},{"content_ids":[56265,56264],"conference_id":158,"event_ids":[56937,56938],"name":"Roman Bohuk","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":null,"title":"Blog","sort_order":0,"url":"https://metactf.com/"},{"description":null,"title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/romanbohuk/"},{"description":null,"title":"X (Twitter)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/RomanBohuk"}],"media":[],"id":56691}],"begin_tsz":"2024-09-06T12:00:00Z","timeband_id":1237,"updated_tsz":"2024-08-27T08:00:04Z","links":[],"end":"2024-09-06T16:00:00.000-0000","id":56937,"tag_ids":[46940,46941,46942,46949,46951],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1725624000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46889,"sort_order":1,"person_id":56677},{"tag_id":46889,"sort_order":1,"person_id":56691}],"tags":"","conference_id":158,"location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"Room 126","hotel":"","short_name":"Room 126","id":46512},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-09-06T12:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-08-27T08:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESNOVA2024","timezone":"America/New_York","link":"","description":"All hackers need tools.

The all-day workshop will feature plenty of group discussions on recent advancements in forensic automation, how the Cloud has evolved from large-scale virtual servers to smaller scalable containers, how IoT devices have extended the logical boundaries of the Cloud, and key similarities and differences between the three major Cloud Service Providers.  There will also be hands-on labs where students can learn more about automating tasks, mirroring and capturing packet data, and open-source tools and techniques that are commonly used in the field.
