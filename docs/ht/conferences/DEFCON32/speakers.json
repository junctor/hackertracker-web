At the age of 13, Marcus was given his first computer, enabling him to begin teaching himself programming. Throughout his teen years he alternated between different programming languages, learning VB, PHP, C, C++, and Assembly. Due to almost exclusively hanging around hacking communities, he eventually found himself making money writing and selling illegal hacking tools. In 2013 Marcus started MalwareTech, an anonymous blog focused on detailing the deep and technical inner workings of malware. The blog became popular among both security professionals and criminal hackers alike. As time went on, he became increasingly uncomfortable with working for cybercriminals and focused on leaving that life behind. Through his blog, Marcus had received several high paying job offers from international security companies, and gained some understanding of the cybersecurity industry. In 2016, he made the decision to transition into cybersecurity, taking a job as a research and development lead at a Los Angeles based firm. On May 2017, Marcus gained worldwide media attention after being outed as the person who stopped WannaCry, an extremely destructive ransomware virus. Reporters were able to track his MalwareTech alias back to his real identity, thrusting him into the spotlight. Three months later, he was arrested by the FBI while attending DEF CON, the world’s largest hacking convention.","media":[],"title":"Cybersecurity Speaker","conference_id":133,"twitter":"","updated_at":"2024-07-21T18:01+0000","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1721584862,"nanoseconds":0},"event_ids":[55580],"name":"Marcus Hutchins","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/malwaretech?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=ios_app"},{"description":"","title":"Mastodon (@malwaretech@infosec.exchange)","sort_order":0,"url":"https://infosec.exchange/@malwaretech"},{"description":"","title":"Website","sort_order":0,"url":"https://marcushutchins.com/"}],"pronouns":"he/him","id":55806},{"content_ids":[55190],"conference":"DEFCON32","link":"","affiliations":[{"organization":"","title":"Red Team Operator & Cybersecurity Researcher"}],"description":"Michaela is the founder of Blacks In Cybersecurity (BIC).

He prefers to hack on software but doesn’t mind getting his hands dirty with hardware when needed. Tiernan believes the best way to determine if he really understands something is if he can successfully explain it to either someone else or create a working implementation in code. This has led him to develop iCLASS/PicoPass card emulation on the Chameleon Tiny/Mini and the Flipper Zero.

Now, he is on a mission to crack the code on quantum security.","media":[],"title":"","conference_id":133,"twitter":"","updated_at":"2024-07-21T18:01+0000","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1721584862,"nanoseconds":0},"event_ids":[56433],"name":"Sorin Boloș","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"id":56224},{"content_ids":[55846],"conference":"DEFCON32","link":"","affiliations":[],"description":"Adrian Coleșa is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca (TUCN) in Romania, where he has dedicated 26 years of service.
