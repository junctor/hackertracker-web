You will learn by doing, not by copying and pasting with modules and labs that will give you the ability to deviate and improvise on your very first malware variants in C++, even if you have no prior C++ experience.\r\nWhere this course differs from others is its reduced need for prior knowledge, and enhanced emphasis on hands-on learning.\r\nBy the end of the course, you will understand and be able to implement:\r\n- Techniques to use the native Win32 API for adversarial tactics, enhancing stealth and offensive efficiency\r\n- Maintaining data/shellcode integrity while using multiple ciphers for obfuscation and encryption\r\n- Modular antivirus evasion techniques that will remain useful through your pen testing career","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1659133200,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[49082],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49085,49129],"name":"Dahvid Schloss","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":48507}],"timeband_id":927,"links":[],"end":"2022-08-16T00:00:00.000-0000","id":49085,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45337,45373,45450],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660575600,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48507}],"tags":"","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"Caesars Forum","hotel":"","short_name":"Caesars Forum","id":45432},"updated":"2022-07-29T22:20:00.000-0000","begin":"2022-08-15T15:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Latest details, requirements, description, cost: https://defcontrainings.myshopify.com/products/chris-greer-tcp-ip-deep-dive-for-hackers-featuring-wireshark\r\n\r\nTraining description:\r\n\r\nAlmost every attack, intrusion, scan, and exfiltration involves the TCP protocol at some point.

In this talk we will talk about common Azure errors that will get you in trouble.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1660509000,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1659283620,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[49183],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49219],"name":"Igal Flegmann","affiliations":[],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/igal_fs"}],"media":[],"id":48637}],"timeband_id":893,"links":[],"end":"2022-08-14T20:30:00.000-0000","id":49219,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660506600,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[40252,45340,45350,45451],"village_id":9,"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48637}],"tags":"Talk","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45445,"name":"Flamingo - Sunset-Scenic Ballroom  (Cloud Village)","hotel":"","short_name":"Sunset-Scenic Ballroom  (Cloud Village)","id":45431},"updated":"2022-07-31T16:07:00.000-0000","begin":"2022-08-14T19:50:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Evolving endpoint protection controls, including hardening and security software with enhanced detection capabilities and greater visibility coverage, have been pushing red team and purple team operational complexity to a higher level.

We often have to stress, to quote from Microsoft: “the forest (not the domain) is the security boundary in an Active Directory implementation”. This means that any compromised child domain could result in a compromised root domain. But why is it so? We guessed the answer must be because of the attack/technique known as Access Token Manipulation: SID-History Injection, which enable a Domain Admin of a child domain to escalate to Enterprise Admin and gain full control of the forest. The attack can be mitigated by enabling SID filtering on the trust relationship, but it is not enabled by default for intra-forest domain trusts. SID Filtering is however enabled for inter-forest trusts by default, as Microsoft explains: “SID filtering helps prevent malicious users with administrative credentials in a trusted forest from taking control of a trusting forest”.\r\n\r\nWhat is interesting is that SID filtering can be enabled on intra-forest domain trust as well and in theory prevent the SID-History injection technique. This posed the question – could SID filtering make the domain a security boundary? Our talk will take the audience through our research on this question. We will demonstrate typical trust attacks, how they can be mitigated, and present our SID filtering research including new techniques we discovered that make intra-forest SID filtering obsolete. Finally, we will explain and demonstrate a trust attack technique for moving from a TRUSTING domain to a TRUSTED domain (opposite direction of other trust attacks) which works even over one-way forest trusts (thereby breaking both Microsoft’s “forest is security boundary” statement and the “Red Forest”/ESAE design). Deep knowledge of Kerberos authentication is not necessary as the attacks are of low complexity, but a basic understanding of the protocol is an advantage. Attacks will be demonstrated using living-off-the-land tools and FOSS tools like Mimikatz and Rubeus. The talk is a summary of our work published in the “SID filter as security boundary between domains?” blog post series where part 1 explains Kerberos authentication between domains: https://improsec.com/tech-blog/o83i79jgzk65bbwn1fwib1ela0rl2d\n\n\n","title":"Don’t be trusted: Active Directory trust attacks","type":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","color":"#54ab76","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","name":"Adversary Village","id":45377},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1660499100,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Not understanding Active Directory domain- and forest trusts can be a big risk.

The challenges will require creative thinking, knowledge in networking, and competency in exploit development to claim the top prize. Prizes will be awarded to the top 3 teams/players at the end of the event\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nIoT Village Hacking CTF is hosted in IoT Village, teams of 1-6 players access a local network filled with IoT devices primed to be exploited. You will compete against others by successfully exploiting real IoT products and finding the hidden flags in each. The hacking contest features more than 30 real-world, vulnerable IoT devices.\r\n\r\nThis event has been redesigned to include challenges which highlight tangible impacts when exploiting real vulnerabilities on real IoT devices. Hidden in the network are devices which require advanced skills to exploit or require creative attack chaining to find the flag. Players will encounter unique hacking scenarios like, exfiltrating files off a NAS to find “clues” or bypassing a router firewall to access a camera on a hidden network to “see” a flag. Prepare to outwit, see, sneak, move, and listen your way through these hidden scenarios which have a cyber-physical effect.\r\n\r\nThe IoT devices in the contest are not simulated and do not contain contrived/made-up vulnerabilities. Competitors must figure out what real-world vulnerabilities exist in these devices and exploit them to get a shell and find the flag. This is what makes the IoT Village CTF special.\r\n\r\nThis 3-time DEF CON Black Badge awarded contest CTF is open to anyone! Our contest provides a wonderful experience to learn more about security and test your skills, and the IoT CTF provides the most realistic hacking experience around!\r\n\r\nA few devices are approachable for entry level people to experience getting their first root shell, but to win this CTF your team must perform detailed network reconnaissance, lateral pivoting, vulnerability research, hardware hacking, firmware analysis, reverse engineering, and exploit development.\r\n\r\nSo, join a team (or even by yourself) and compete for fun and prizes!

Most research to date has focused on the core AWS services, such as , S3, EC2, IAM, CodeBuild, Lambda, KMS, etc. In our research, we present our analysis on a previously overlooked attack surface that is ripe for abuse in the wrong hands - an AWS Service called Amazon AppStream 2.0.\r\nAmazon AppStream 2.0 is a fully managed desktop service that provides users with instant access to their desktop applications from anywhere. Using AppStream 2.0, you can add your desktop applications to a virtual machine and share access to the VM by sharing a link - without requiring any credentials, you can share an image (an attack toolset) with a target account without needing any approval from the other side or attach some privileged role to an image and get those credentials.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, you'll learn about how AppStream works, how misconfigurations and excessive IAM permissions can be abused to compromise your AWS environment and allow attackers to control your entire AWS account. We'll cover tactics such as persistence, lateral movement, exfiltration, social engineering, and privilege escalation. We will also cover the key indicators of compromise for security incidents in AppStream and how to prevent these abuse cases, showing how excessive privileges without great monitoring could become a nightmare in your Cloud Security posture, making possible attackers control your AWS account.\n\n\n","title":"Understanding, Abusing and Monitoring AWS AppStream 2.0","type":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","color":"#7caa57","name":"Cloud Village","id":45350},"android_description":"Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a complex ecosystem with hundreds of different services.

But if the hosting company doesn't set pentesters up for success, the likelihood of a worthwhile pentest is abysmally low.

Not even the stealthiest of targets can hide in the darkness for long, when their pursuers are armed with predator-specific investigative skills, a roadmap of their weaknesses and, of course, a white hat.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1660432500,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1659974820,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[49730],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49920],"name":"Jessica Smith","affiliations":[],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/scarlettsleuth"}],"media":[],"id":49063}],"timeband_id":892,"links":[],"end":"2022-08-13T23:15:00.000-0000","id":49920,"village_id":26,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660431000,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[40268,45331,45373,45384,45453],"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49063}],"tags":"Lightning Talk","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45490,"name":"LINQ - 3rd flr - Social B and C (Recon Village)","hotel":"","short_name":"Social B and C (Recon Village)","id":45415},"begin":"2022-08-13T22:50:00.000-0000","updated":"2022-08-08T16:07:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"","type":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","color":"#d5f67c","name":"Misinformation Village","id":45335},"title":"Ad it up: To minimize mis- and dis-information, we must reshape the ad tech business, not regulate speech","android_description":"","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1660432500,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1659128280,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[49070],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49073],"name":"Jessica Dheere","affiliations":[{"organization":"Ranking Digital Rights","title":""}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":48484,"title":"Ranking Digital Rights"}],"timeband_id":892,"links":[],"end":"2022-08-13T23:15:00.000-0000","id":49073,"village_id":18,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660430700,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[40260,45333,45335,45450],"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48484}],"tags":"Guest Speaker","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45436,"name":"Caesars Forum - Summit 220->236 (Misinformation Village)","hotel":"","short_name":"220->236 (Misinformation Village)","id":45402},"begin":"2022-08-13T22:45:00.000-0000","updated":"2022-07-29T20:58:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"The Trace Labs Search Party CTF is a non theoretical, gamified effort that allows for the crowdsourcing of contestants to perform a single task: Conduct open source intelligence operations to help find missing persons\r\n \r\nYou can have teams of 1-4 people, 4 person teams provide many benefits which include the coaching of more junior members.

Log all accepted and blocked network flows on the firewall\r\n\r\nSanitize and validate all client-supplied input data\r\n\r\nEnforce strong URL schema\r\n\r\nDisallow HTTP redirections\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBlockchain Application Security (BAS) lacks specific security guidance and resource. The Blockchain may be secure however applications sitting on the blockchain may not. Most Web3 Application have HTML front-ends; in result, security controls correlating to the OWASP Framework centered around traditional web application security is critical.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1660433400,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1659917160,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[49651],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49835],"name":"Kennashka DeSilva","affiliations":[],"links":[{"description":null,"title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/mwlite/in/kennashka-desilva-7186b0175"}],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":49011},{"content_ids":[49651],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49835],"name":"Aimee Reyes","affiliations":[],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":null,"title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"http://linkedin.com/in/reyesai"}],"media":[],"id":49013}],"timeband_id":892,"links":[],"end":"2022-08-13T23:30:00.000-0000","id":49835,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660429800,"nanoseconds":0},"village_id":4,"tag_ids":[40278,45340,45345,45378,45451],"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49013},{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49011}],"tags":"Talk","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45421,"name":"Flamingo - Twilight Ballroom - AppSec Village - Main Stage","hotel":"","short_name":"Main Stage","id":45517},"updated":"2022-08-08T00:06:00.000-0000","begin":"2022-08-13T22:30:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Get a free signed copy of the #1bestseller Hackable and meet the author!\n\n\n","type":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","color":"#d17648","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","name":"IoT Village","id":45356},"title":"Hackable Book Signing","android_description":"Get a free signed copy of the #1bestseller Hackable and meet the author!","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1660431600,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1659712440,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[49446],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49650],"name":"Ted Harrington","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":48829}],"timeband_id":892,"links":[],"end":"2022-08-13T23:00:00.000-0000","id":49650,"village_id":16,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660429800,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[40275,45341,45356,45450],"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48829}],"tags":"Village Event","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45434,"name":"Caesars Forum - Alliance 311, 320 (IoT Village)","hotel":"","short_name":"311, 320 (IoT Village)","id":45424},"spans_timebands":"N","updated":"2022-08-05T15:14:00.000-0000","begin":"2022-08-13T22:30:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Chess, computers, and hacking go way back.

Whether you're red, blue or just container curious this workshop is for you. \n\nIn this workshop, you will get hands-on with containers and kubernetes, - starting with introductory content - learning how they work, where and how to hide or find things, how to identify indicators of compromise, indicators of attack, and how to apply analysis to gain a deeper understanding of container malware and what is going on inside containers. \n\nThis workshop will utilize the Google Cloud Platform alongside command line operands and a small amount of open source tooling to learn both offensive and defense techniques on containers.  By the end, you’ll have a solid mental model of how containers work, how they are managed and deployed, and be equipped with the ability to analyze container images, identify problems, and identify familiar patterns.  Ultimately, these skills will allow you to generate valuable insights for your organization’s defense or aid you in your next attack. \n\nThis is a fast-paced course designed to take you deep into the world of containers, making tooling like Kubernetes much more intuitive and easy to understand. Labs will be used to reinforce your learnings, and the course comes with very detailed notes and instructions for setup which you can repeat on your own time.

We hope to send out instructions to attendees prior to the class, so they can be ready on the day. \n\nPrereq:\nNone, the class is well designed to allow those with little to no linux, kubernetes or cloud familiarity to follow along, but a basic familiarity with Linux and terminal will allow attendees to focus on the work.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1659157980,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[49134],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49157],"name":"Adrian Wood","affiliations":[{"organization":"","title":"Security Researcher"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":48547,"title":"Security Researcher"},{"content_ids":[49134],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49157],"name":"David Mitchell","affiliations":[{"organization":"","title":"Red Team"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":48553,"title":"Red Team"},{"content_ids":[49134],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49157],"name":"Griffin Francis","affiliations":[{"organization":"","title":"Security Research Consultant"}],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/aussinfosec"}],"media":[],"id":48558,"title":"Security Research Consultant"}],"timeband_id":892,"links":[],"end":"2022-08-14T01:00:00.000-0000","id":49157,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660424400,"nanoseconds":0},"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45336,45344,45373,45452],"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48547},{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48553},{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48558}],"tags":"","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45439,"name":"Harrah's - Elko (Workshops)","hotel":"","short_name":"Elko (Workshops)","id":45484},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2022-08-13T21:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2022-07-30T05:13:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Attack Web applications with: command injection, SQL injection, Cross-Site Request Forgery, Cross-Site Scripting, cookie manipulation, Server-Side Template Injection, and more.

At DefCon 22 in the aftermath of Heartbleed, John Menerick told us to \"keep calm and hide the internet\". Alas, they found it. The policy community in the US, and lesser extent Europe, is finally starting to put serious focus on software security including open source. This event will bring hackers together with policymakers to identify policies on the book that could help improve the open source ecosystem and the security of software.

We believe that this solution, although simple, can significantly mitigate the challenges facing the Internet.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1660427100,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1658375400,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[48557],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[48503],"name":"John Midgley","affiliations":[{"organization":"","title":"Cult of the Dead Cow"}],"links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-midgley-5991/"}],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":47891,"title":"Cult of the Dead Cow"}],"timeband_id":892,"links":[{"label":"DEF CON Forum","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/242204"}],"end":"2022-08-13T21:45:00.000-0000","id":48503,"tag_ids":[45241,45279,45281,45375,45450],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660424400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"Demo, Tool","people":[{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":47891}],"tags":"","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45435,"name":"Caesars Forum - Forum 104-105, 135-136 (Track 1)","hotel":"","short_name":"104-105, 135-136 (Track 1)","id":45372},"begin":"2022-08-13T21:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2022-07-21T03:50:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"It's been a long 12 years since the last time an Internet Wars panel was held at DEF CON, in that time a lot has changed, and a lot has not.

We hope to use 2-3 OT relevant examples of what can be done and what we believe should be done within OT environments to better understand how to defend and detect within them.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1659473460,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[49347],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49447],"name":"Marissa Costa","affiliations":[{"organization":"Dragos","title":"Industrial Penetration Tester II"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":48762,"title":"Industrial Penetration Tester II at Dragos"},{"content_ids":[49347],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49447],"name":"Todd Keller","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":48779}],"timeband_id":892,"links":[],"end":"2022-08-13T20:30:00.000-0000","id":49447,"tag_ids":[40258,45340,45369,45375,45450],"village_id":15,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660420800,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48762},{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48779}],"tags":"Talk","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45434,"name":"Caesars Forum - Alliance 314 - 319 (ICS Village)","hotel":"","short_name":"314 - 319 (ICS Village)","id":45430},"begin":"2022-08-13T20:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2022-08-02T20:51:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"New to lock picking?

In this context of improving security, Python language has something more to say. During the talk will be presented several techniques that can be leveraged using a Python implant to bypass modern defenses by:\r\n\r\n1.

Python provides “audit hooks” (ref. https://peps.python.org/pep-0578/ ) that can make Python runtime actions visible to auditing tools. However, audit hooks are not enabled by default in Python official bundle since they will downgrade performance.

In our talk, we’ll present a machine learning prototype that leverages this forgotten knowledge, helping analysts triage malicious alerts in a feedback loop.

We also discuss more advanced use-cases that Stratus Red Team allows, such as running it on a schedule in your CI/CD to continuously validate that the expected alerts are popping up in your SIEM.\r\n\r\nWe conclude with a live demo where we 'detonate' attack techniques against a live Kubernetes cluster and AWS account.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1659283140,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[49177],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49213],"name":"Christophe Tafani-Dereeper","affiliations":[],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/christophetd"}],"media":[],"id":48631}],"timeband_id":892,"links":[],"end":"2022-08-13T19:00:00.000-0000","id":49213,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660414800,"nanoseconds":0},"village_id":9,"tag_ids":[40252,45340,45350,45451],"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48631}],"tags":"Talk","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45445,"name":"Flamingo - Sunset-Scenic Ballroom  (Cloud Village)","hotel":"","short_name":"Sunset-Scenic Ballroom  (Cloud Village)","id":45431},"spans_timebands":"N","updated":"2022-07-31T15:59:00.000-0000","begin":"2022-08-13T18:20:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"","title":"Three Time's a Charm: Our Experience at the Public Hacking Trials of the Brazilian Election Systems","type":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","color":"#9d9a7e","name":"Voting Village","id":45387},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1660417200,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1660259160,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[49765],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49963],"name":"Ivo de Carvalho Peixinho","affiliations":[{"organization":"","title":"Cybercrime Researcher and Forensic Expert"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":49104,"title":"Cybercrime Researcher and Forensic Expert"}],"timeband_id":892,"links":[],"end":"2022-08-13T19:00:00.000-0000","id":49963,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660413600,"nanoseconds":0},"village_id":34,"tag_ids":[40279,45348,45387,45450],"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49104}],"tags":"Pre-Recorded Content","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45434,"name":"Caesars Forum - Alliance 313-314, 320 (Voting Village)","hotel":"","short_name":"313-314, 320 (Voting Village)","id":45416},"spans_timebands":"N","updated":"2022-08-11T23:06:00.000-0000","begin":"2022-08-13T18:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Most people think that incident response only involves using cool tools in detecting and responding to cyber threats.

Finally, I will speak about my practical experiences in this space, describing the repercussions of an adversary successfully executing these attacks in the wild.\r\n\r\nAttendees will walk away from this talk with the knowledge and tools to attack RL models, as well as an appreciation for the importance of properly securing machine learning systems.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1659292800,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[49039],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49042],"name":"Dr. Amanda Minnich ","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":48462}],"timeband_id":892,"links":[],"end":"2022-08-13T18:50:00.000-0000","id":49042,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660413600,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[40248,45330,45450],"village_id":3,"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48462}],"tags":"","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45436,"name":"Caesars Forum - Summit 220->236 (AI Village)","hotel":"","short_name":"220->236 (AI Village)","id":45410},"begin":"2022-08-13T18:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2022-07-31T18:40:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"The Manufacturers Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security, or MDS2, has become increasingly ubiquitous as a source of information about the security capabilities of IoMT devices, but many organizations still find operationalizing the information contained within to be challenging.

We never threw anything out and learned how to repurpose and abuse tech from the 1940s.\n \nAs a rock’n’roll engineer, I learned to live with constant systems epic failures. Anything that could break would break: before a live TV event or a massive concert. Talk about lessons in Disaster Recovery and Incident Response.\n \nThis talk, chock full of pictures and stories from the past, covers my hacking path as a kid then as a necessary part of survival in the entertainment industry. 1958-1981.\n \nCome on down for the ride and see how 64 years of lessons learned can give you an entirely different view of Hacking and how and why I have embraced failure for both of my careers!","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1658375400,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[48543],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[48534],"name":"Winn Schwartau","affiliations":[{"organization":"","title":"Security Thinker Since 1983"}],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Facebook","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/winn.schwartau"},{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/winnschwartau/"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/WinnSchwartau"},{"description":"","title":"Website","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.winnschwartau.com/"}],"media":[],"id":47851,"title":"Security Thinker Since 1983"}],"timeband_id":892,"links":[{"label":"DEF CON Forum","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/241818"}],"end":"2022-08-13T18:45:00.000-0000","id":48534,"tag_ids":[45241,45375,45450],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660413600,"nanoseconds":0},"village_id":null,"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":47851}],"tags":"","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45435,"name":"Caesars Forum - Forum 106-110, 138-139 (Track 2)","hotel":"","short_name":"106-110, 138-139 (Track 2)","id":45373},"updated":"2022-07-21T03:50:00.000-0000","begin":"2022-08-13T18:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"In February of 2022, I received a LinkedIn connection request from an unknown account that appeared to be illegitimate.

Teams can have 1-4 players.\r\n\r\nAdditional Information: The toolkit required to access any of our specialized hardware/equipment will be provided by us.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1660438800,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1659991380,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"timeband_id":892,"end":"2022-08-14T01:00:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"YouTube","type":"link","url":"https://youtu.be/AanKdrrQ0u0"},{"label":"DEF CON Forum","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/241399"},{"label":"Discord","type":"link","url":"https://discord.com/channels/708208267699945503/864187671776329738"},{"label":"Twitter","type":"link","url":"https://twitter.com/icsctf"}],"id":49925,"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660410000,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[45360,45373,45450],"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45436,"name":"Caesars Forum - Summit 206-208, 238, 237, 234 (Contest Area)","hotel":"","short_name":"206-208, 238, 237, 234 (Contest Area)","id":45468},"begin":"2022-08-13T17:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2022-08-08T20:43:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"","title":"Attack Surface Management Panel","type":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","color":"#bab7d9","name":"Recon Village","id":45384},"android_description":"","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1660413000,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1659974520,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[49724],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49914],"name":"Ben Sadeghipour","affiliations":[],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/NahamSec"}],"media":[],"id":48502}],"timeband_id":892,"links":[],"end":"2022-08-13T17:50:00.000-0000","id":49914,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660410000,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[40268,45367,45373,45384,45453],"village_id":26,"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48502}],"tags":"Panel","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45490,"name":"LINQ - 3rd flr - Social B and C (Recon Village)","hotel":"","short_name":"Social B and C (Recon Village)","id":45415},"begin":"2022-08-13T17:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2022-08-08T16:02:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Math without the tears ior homework!

Whether you’re an attacker, defender, business executive, or brand new to this community, you can learn by witnessing firsthand how easy it is for some competitors to schmooze their way to their goals and how well prepared some companies are to shut down those competitors!","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1660417200,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1659671340,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"timeband_id":892,"end":"2022-08-13T19:00:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Website","type":"link","url":"https://www.se.community/events/vishing-competition/"},{"label":"Twitter","type":"link","url":"https://twitter.com/sec_defcon"}],"id":49495,"tag_ids":[40273,45359,45370,45453],"village_id":31,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660406400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"Competition","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45490,"name":"LINQ - 3rd flr - Social A (Social Engineering Community)","hotel":"","short_name":"Social A (Social Engineering Community)","id":45418},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2022-08-13T16:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2022-08-05T03:49:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"The chillout lounge in Caesars Forum will have live music; all other chillout lounges will have music live-streamed from there. \r\n\r\nAll chillout lounges are planned to be open 09:00 - 18:00 for chillout purposes.

But how do computers connect directly to each other without having external IP addresses, using an insecure protocol like UPnP, manually port forwarding, or routing through intermediary services like Signal, Skype, or Telegram?  The traditional solution to this problem has been to trust companies and just route our data though their servers.  We can totally trust them, right?  If the future of secure communication depends on companies to route our traffic, then I would argue that the future of communications is insecure.  There must be a better solution more in line with privacy fundamentals.\n \nReverse Network Tunneling, i.e. UDP Hole Punching, is a powerful technique that makes it possible for computers with internal IP addresses that are inaccessible on the Internet to be able to connect to each other directly, and therefore become accessible.

But how do computers connect directly to each other without having external IP addresses, using an insecure protocol like UPnP, manually port forwarding, or routing through intermediary services like Signal, Skype, or Telegram?  The traditional solution to this problem has been to trust companies and just route our data though their servers.  We can totally trust them, right?  If the future of secure communication depends on companies to route our traffic, then I would argue that the future of communications is insecure.  There must be a better solution more in line with privacy fundamentals.\n \nReverse Network Tunneling, i.e. UDP Hole Punching, is a powerful technique that makes it possible for computers with internal IP addresses that are inaccessible on the Internet to be able to connect to each other directly, and therefore become accessible.

After the presentation, attendees will be able to try out the modified browser in person and the download for it’s Firefox Profile will be posted on the DCG 201 blog!","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1660356000,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1660257240,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[49754],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49952],"name":"sidepocket","affiliations":[],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/defcon201nj"}],"media":[],"id":49092}],"timeband_id":891,"end":"2022-08-13T02:00:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"URL","type":"link","url":"https://account.altvr.com/events/2059997537997160822"}],"id":49952,"tag_ids":[45374,45449],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660352400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49092}],"tags":"","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45476,"name":"Virtual - DEF CON Groups VR","hotel":"","short_name":"DEF CON Groups VR","id":45523},"begin":"2022-08-13T01:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2022-08-11T22:34:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"https://www.se.community/presentations/#ethics-panel\n\n\n","title":"Ethics, morality & the law","type":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","color":"#504dd0","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","name":"Social Engineering Community Village","id":45370},"android_description":"https://www.se.community/presentations/#ethics-panel","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1660356000,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1659504000,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"timeband_id":891,"links":[],"end":"2022-08-13T02:00:00.000-0000","id":49491,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660352400,"nanoseconds":0},"village_id":31,"tag_ids":[40273,45367,45370,45453],"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"Panel","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45490,"name":"LINQ - 3rd flr - Social A (Social Engineering Community)","hotel":"","short_name":"Social A (Social Engineering Community)","id":45418},"spans_timebands":"N","updated":"2022-08-03T05:20:00.000-0000","begin":"2022-08-13T01:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"18:00 - 19:00: Hildebrand Magic\r\n19:00 - 20:00: Dual Core\r\n20:00 - 21:00: Icetre Normal\r\n21:00 - 22:00: n0x08\r\n22:00 - 23:00: Skittish & Bus\r\n23:00 - 00:00: Biolux\r\n00:00 - 00:15: Costume Contest\r\n00:15 - 01:15: Miss Jackalope\r\n01:15 - 02:00: Keith Myers\r\n\r\nThe party starts at 18:00; everyone can come whenever they like.

Yet the same tactics that malicious actors use in emotional exploitation are present in news, advertising, social media, and marketing. These are multi-billion industries driving our very way of life. Can all influence systems be malicious or is there a range of ethics presented by the need to communicate potential value relationships? The tactics described by the best Social Engineers often involve soft skills traditions like active listening, building rapport, and communicating needs clearly. Social Engineering is a critical part of how we navigate relationships at work and home. Don’t you dress better and shine a bit brighter on that first date?

Yet the same tactics that malicious actors use in emotional exploitation are present in news, advertising, social media, and marketing. These are multi-billion industries driving our very way of life. Can all influence systems be malicious or is there a range of ethics presented by the need to communicate potential value relationships? The tactics described by the best Social Engineers often involve soft skills traditions like active listening, building rapport, and communicating needs clearly. Social Engineering is a critical part of how we navigate relationships at work and home. Don’t you dress better and shine a bit brighter on that first date? Aren’t you trying your hardest to communicate your value to your boss? Like it or not, Social Engineering is a part of our every day lives. You can ignore it and risk becoming a victim or use it to enhance your relationships.

This talk focuses on bridging that gap by providing a way for researchers to create their own patch antennas without deep electrical engineering experience.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1660343400,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1659928560,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[49661],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49849],"name":"Erwin","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":49026}],"timeband_id":891,"links":[],"end":"2022-08-12T22:30:00.000-0000","id":49849,"tag_ids":[40267,45340,45373,45383,45451],"village_id":25,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660339800,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":49026}],"tags":"Talk","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45445,"name":"Flamingo - Eldorado Ballroom  (Radio Frequency Village)","hotel":"","short_name":"Eldorado Ballroom  (Radio Frequency Village)","id":45427},"updated":"2022-08-08T03:16:00.000-0000","begin":"2022-08-12T21:30:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Adversary Simulator booth will have hands-on adversary emulation plans specific to a wide variety of threat-actors - ransomware, these are meant to provide the participant/visitor with a better understanding of the Adversary tactics.\n\n\n","type":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","color":"#54ab76","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","name":"Adversary Village","id":45377},"title":"Adversary Booth","android_description":"Adversary Simulator booth will have hands-on adversary emulation plans specific to a wide variety of threat-actors - ransomware, these are meant to provide the participant/visitor with a better understanding of the Adversary tactics.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1660350600,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1659886380,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[49570],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49776,49778,49779,49780,49781],"name":"Michael Kouremetis","affiliations":[{"organization":"MITRE Corporation","title":"Lead Cyber Operations Engineer and Group Lead"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":48920,"title":"Lead Cyber Operations Engineer and Group Lead at MITRE Corporation"},{"content_ids":[49570],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49776,49778,49779,49780,49781],"name":"Melanie Chan","affiliations":[{"organization":"MITRE Corporation","title":"Senior Cybersecurity Engineer & Intern Coordinator"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":48921,"title":"Senior Cybersecurity Engineer & Intern Coordinator at MITRE Corporation"},{"content_ids":[49570],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49776,49778,49779,49780,49781],"name":"Ethan Michalak","affiliations":[{"organization":"MITRE Corporation","title":"Cyber Security Intern"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":48930,"title":"Cyber Security Intern at MITRE Corporation"},{"content_ids":[49570],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49776,49778,49779,49780,49781],"name":"Dean Lawrence","affiliations":[{"organization":"MITRE Corporation","title":"Software Systems Engineer"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":48932,"title":"Software Systems Engineer at MITRE Corporation"},{"content_ids":[49570],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49776,49778,49779,49780,49781],"name":"Jay Yee","affiliations":[{"organization":"MITRE Corporation","title":"Senior Cyber Security Engineer, Defensive Cyber Operations"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":48946,"title":"Senior Cyber Security Engineer, Defensive Cyber Operations at MITRE Corporation"}],"timeband_id":891,"links":[],"end":"2022-08-13T00:30:00.000-0000","id":49778,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660339800,"nanoseconds":0},"village_id":1,"tag_ids":[40246,45364,45373,45377,45451],"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48932},{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48930},{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48946},{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48921},{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48920}],"tags":"Educational Event","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45445,"name":"Flamingo - Sunset-Scenic Ballroom (Adversary Village)","hotel":"","short_name":"Sunset-Scenic Ballroom (Adversary Village)","id":45411},"spans_timebands":"N","updated":"2022-08-07T15:33:00.000-0000","begin":"2022-08-12T21:30:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"This workshop is on Messages to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (METI) and their principles.

However, we can also leverage existing technology to detect and protect from cyberattacks.\nThe Top 20 Secure PLC Coding Practices (www.plc-security.com) is a community-led effort to identify best practices in Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) code development that improve cybersecurity.\nIn this workshop, you will learn how to program a PLC and connect it to a SCADA system.

This helps evaluate if normal user interaction may result in models recommending exploitable coding.\r\n\r\nResources will include a GitHub repo, runnable notebooks, and a form to suggest new prompts for code generation.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1659292500,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[49035],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49038],"name":"Nick Dorion ","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":48469}],"timeband_id":891,"links":[],"end":"2022-08-12T21:50:00.000-0000","id":49038,"tag_ids":[40248,45330,45450],"village_id":3,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660338000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48469}],"tags":"","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45436,"name":"Caesars Forum - Summit 220->236 (AI Village)","hotel":"","short_name":"220->236 (AI Village)","id":45410},"begin":"2022-08-12T21:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2022-07-31T18:35:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Video presentation outlining the benefits of Sysmon for investigations.\r\n\r\nBlue Team Village’s Project Obsidian is an immersive, defensive cybersecurity learning experience that provides attendees with the opportunity to gain knowledge of Incident Response (IR), Digital Forensics (DF), Reverse Engineering Malware (REM), Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), and Cyber Threat Hunting (CTH).\n\n\nIn this video we will discuss Sysmon -- what it is, how to get it, the configuration file, the events it logs, and why it's so valuable to forensic investigations.\r\n\r\nBlue Team Village’s Project Obsidian is an immersive, defensive cybersecurity learning experience that provides attendees with the opportunity to gain knowledge of Incident Response (IR), Digital Forensics (DF), Reverse Engineering Malware (REM), Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), and Cyber Threat Hunting (CTH).","title":"Obsidian Forensics: The Importance of Sysmon for Investigations","type":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","color":"#97ab92","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","name":"Blue Team Village","id":45376},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1660341600,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Video presentation outlining the benefits of Sysmon for investigations.\r\n\r\nBlue Team Village’s Project Obsidian is an immersive, defensive cybersecurity learning experience that provides attendees with the opportunity to gain knowledge of Incident Response (IR), Digital Forensics (DF), Reverse Engineering Malware (REM), Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), and Cyber Threat Hunting (CTH).\n\n\nIn this video we will discuss Sysmon -- what it is, how to get it, the configuration file, the events it logs, and why it's so valuable to forensic investigations.\r\n\r\nBlue Team Village’s Project Obsidian is an immersive, defensive cybersecurity learning experience that provides attendees with the opportunity to gain knowledge of Incident Response (IR), Digital Forensics (DF), Reverse Engineering Malware (REM), Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), and Cyber Threat Hunting (CTH).","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1659044280,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[48909,48931,48924,48938],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[48911,48925,48932,48938],"name":"ExtremePaperClip","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":48364}],"timeband_id":891,"links":[],"end":"2022-08-12T22:00:00.000-0000","id":48932,"village_id":7,"tag_ids":[40250,45332,45373,45376,45451],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660338000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48364}],"tags":"Workshop","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45398,"name":"Flamingo - Savoy Ballroom - BTV Project Obsidian: Track 0x41 (In-person)","hotel":"","short_name":"BTV Project Obsidian: Track 0x41 (In-person)","id":45471},"begin":"2022-08-12T21:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2022-07-28T21:38:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"A quick introduction to malware analysis, Powershell script analysis, and how to not panic when VirusTotal shrugs.\r\n\r\nBlue Team Village’s Project Obsidian is an immersive, defensive cybersecurity learning experience that provides attendees with the opportunity to gain knowledge of Incident Response (IR), Digital Forensics (DF), Reverse Engineering Malware (REM), Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), and Cyber Threat Hunting (CTH).\n\n\nSo you just got a bunch of Powershell scripts dumped on you.

And sometimes, a simple misconfiguration or a vulnerability in web applications, is all an attacker needs to compromise the entire infrastructure. Since cloud is relatively new, many developers are not fully aware of the threatscape and they end up deploying a vulnerable cloud infrastructure. When it comes to web application pentesting on traditional infrastructure, deliberately vulnerable applications such as DVWA and bWAPP have helped the infosec community in understanding the popular web attack vectors. However, at this point in time, we do not have a similar framework for the cloud environment.   In this talk, we will be introducing AWSGoat, a vulnerable by design infrastructure on AWS featuring the latest released OWASP Top 10 web application security risks (2021) and other misconfiguration based on services such as IAM, S3, API Gateway, Lambda, EC2, and ECS.

And sometimes, a simple misconfiguration or a vulnerability in web applications, is all an attacker needs to compromise the entire infrastructure. Since cloud is relatively new, many developers are not fully aware of the threatscape and they end up deploying a vulnerable cloud infrastructure. When it comes to web application pentesting on traditional infrastructure, deliberately vulnerable applications such as DVWA and bWAPP have helped the infosec community in understanding the popular web attack vectors. However, at this point in time, we do not have a similar framework for the cloud environment.   In this talk, we will be introducing AWSGoat, a vulnerable by design infrastructure on AWS featuring the latest released OWASP Top 10 web application security risks (2021) and other misconfiguration based on services such as IAM, S3, API Gateway, Lambda, EC2, and ECS. AWSGoat mimics real-world infrastructure but with added vulnerabilities. The idea behind AWSGoat is to provide security enthusiasts and pen-testers with an easy to deploy/destroy vulnerable infrastructure where they can learn how to enumerate cloud applications, identify vulnerabilities, and chain various attacks to compromise the AWS account.

This precision in many ways is what enables adversary emulation, and makes it, well, emulation. It allows us to confidently and accurately call something “in the spirit of APT29”. In many cases, in an effort to try to be precise, we narrow the focus of our evaluations and only implement the limited procedures an adversary is known to perform. But what happens if procedural information is not available for a specific adversary? We have to make an assumption about them. We do our best to get in their mindset. We consider what we believe to be their end goals, but in the end, we are left with a couple choices. We can make an educated guess, but in this case we fall into the same trapping of above - a narrowed focus that might not even be accurate. The alternate is to implement a variety of procedures and hope that we effectively cover our bases. Procedural variation looks at a single technique or sub-technique, and implements them in different ways, ideally to trigger different data sources, and thus potentially different defensive capabilities. It is for this reason that over the past year, there has been an increased awareness and advocacy for procedural variation. Procedural variation gives us greater confidence that when we say we have a defensive for the technique under test, the defense will actually work. Procedural variation comes with its own challenges; increased development costs and potentially reducing the accuracy of our emulations are only the start of that conversation. So how do we balance the benefits of procedure variation with the challenges? In this talk, we will present the key considerations to make when designing your ATT&CK test plans so that you can maximize your test plan’s bang-for-the-buck, gaining the key confidence that procedural variation offers while staying true to threat intelligence, and doing all of this while keeping budget in the back of our minds.\n\n\n","type":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","color":"#54ab76","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","name":"Adversary Village","id":45377},"title":"Balancing the Scales of Just-Good-Enough","android_description":"In MITRE ATT&CK, techniques describe the means by which adversaries achieve tactical goals, sub-techniques describe the same means but a more specific level, and procedures describe the variations that are precise implementations of those techniques.

Procedural variation looks at a single technique or sub-technique, and implements them in different ways, ideally to trigger different data sources, and thus potentially different defensive capabilities. It is for this reason that over the past year, there has been an increased awareness and advocacy for procedural variation. Procedural variation gives us greater confidence that when we say we have a defensive for the technique under test, the defense will actually work. Procedural variation comes with its own challenges; increased development costs and potentially reducing the accuracy of our emulations are only the start of that conversation. So how do we balance the benefits of procedure variation with the challenges? In this talk, we will present the key considerations to make when designing your ATT&CK test plans so that you can maximize your test plan’s bang-for-the-buck, gaining the key confidence that procedural variation offers while staying true to threat intelligence, and doing all of this while keeping budget in the back of our minds.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1660337100,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1659888540,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[49581],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49793],"name":"Ian Davila","affiliations":[{"organization":"Tidal Cyber","title":"Lead Adversary Emulation Engineer"}],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-davila/"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/advemuian"}],"media":[],"id":48928,"title":"Lead Adversary Emulation Engineer at Tidal Cyber"},{"content_ids":[49581],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49793],"name":"Frank Duff","affiliations":[],"links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/frank-duff-b713851b/"},{"description":"","title":"Twitter","sort_order":0,"url":"https://twitter.com/frankduff"}],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":48929}],"timeband_id":891,"links":[],"end":"2022-08-12T20:45:00.000-0000","id":49793,"village_id":1,"tag_ids":[40246,45340,45373,45377,45451],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660335300,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48929},{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48928}],"tags":"Talk","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45445,"name":"Flamingo - Sunset-Scenic Ballroom (Adversary Village)","hotel":"","short_name":"Sunset-Scenic Ballroom (Adversary Village)","id":45411},"begin":"2022-08-12T20:15:00.000-0000","updated":"2022-08-07T16:09:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Securing application or infrastructure code in the Cloud is more than just scoping permissions in IAM and scanning ECS, EKS and EC2 instances.

My goal is not to create fear, uncertainty, and doubt but to help clarify the risk and mitigation strategy.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1660332600,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1659282240,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[49166,49182],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49202,49218],"name":"Jay Chen","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":48636}],"timeband_id":891,"links":[],"end":"2022-08-12T19:30:00.000-0000","id":49202,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660331400,"nanoseconds":0},"village_id":9,"tag_ids":[40252,45331,45350,45451],"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48636}],"tags":"Lightning Talk","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45445,"name":"Flamingo - Sunset-Scenic Ballroom  (Cloud Village)","hotel":"","short_name":"Sunset-Scenic Ballroom  (Cloud Village)","id":45431},"updated":"2022-07-31T15:44:00.000-0000","begin":"2022-08-12T19:10:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Adversaries have increasingly been leveraging completely legitimate 3rd party web hosting products to circumvent traditional domain reputation analysis engines, and successfully get their phishing pages in front of their victims.

This Human Vulnerability, Exploitation, Tools & Tactics (HVETT) database will be a significant resource for the prevention, analysis, and attribution of threat actors across tactical, operational, and strategic threats. \r\n\r\nWe begin by introducing the concept and scope of cognitive security, discuss framework development,  and provide an overview of how and why humans are vulnerable to MDM operations. Next, we will discuss how technologically mediated communications (TMCs) and synthetic media (such as deep fakes) exacerbate these vulnerabilities by adding new attack vectors. After establishing this foundation, we introduce the HVETT database and discuss potential applications to real-world challenges.  Finally, we conclude with a series of recent examples of exploits and tactics which threaten the cognitive security of every human with access to TMCs.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1660333860,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[49053],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49056],"name":"Matthew Canham","affiliations":[{"organization":"Beyond Layer Seven","title":""}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":48487,"title":"Beyond Layer Seven"}],"timeband_id":891,"links":[],"end":"2022-08-12T20:30:00.000-0000","id":49056,"tag_ids":[40260,45331,45335,45450],"village_id":18,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660329000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48487}],"tags":"Lightning Talk","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45436,"name":"Caesars Forum -

Attribution is one of the most complicated aspects of cybersecurity, and it is easy to make mistakes because the underlying architecture of the internet offers numerous ways for attackers to hide their tracks. Threat actors can use false flags to deceive the security community about their identity, and natural human bias can lead researchers in the wrong direction. In this presentation, I will discuss three of the biggest lessons I’ve learned with regards to attribution—and how researchers can avoid making the same errors.\r\n \r\nThe first mistake is related to perception bias. The Olympic Destroyer was a cyber-sabotage attack that happened during the PyeongChang Winter Olympic in 2018. Many security vendors published information about the substance of the attack alongside unclear speculation about who was ultimately behind it. During the early stage of my Olympic Destroyer research, I strongly believed a North Korea-linked threat actor was behind the attack. Looking back, I’m overwhelmed by my confirmation bias at that time. The relationship between North Korea and South Korea was relatively stable during the Olympics, but North Korea sometimes attacked South Korea regardless. Therefore, I assumed the attack was associated with a North Korean threat actor that wanted to sow chaos during the Olympic season. However, my colleague discovered a fascinating rich header false flag designed to disguise the fact that this attack was carried out by an unrelated threat actor. Also, I confirmed that the threat actor behind this attack utilized a totally different modus operandi than the presumed North Korean threat actor after an in-depth, onsite investigation. I had allowed my perception bias to hinder my attribution efforts.\r\n\r\nThe second mistake occurred as a result of an over-reliance on third-party functions.\r\nResearchers are often inclined to rely on too many third-party tools, and occasionally this blind faith causes mistakes. One day, I discovered that one Korean-speaking threat actor utilized a 0-day exploit embedded in a Word document. Based on the metadata of the malicious document, I used Virustotal to find additional documents with similar metadata. All of them had the same language code page, which made me even more biased. From then, I started going in the wrong direction. I totally believed that those documents were created by the same threat actor.

Attribution is one of the most complicated aspects of cybersecurity, and it is easy to make mistakes because the underlying architecture of the internet offers numerous ways for attackers to hide their tracks. Threat actors can use false flags to deceive the security community about their identity, and natural human bias can lead researchers in the wrong direction. In this presentation, I will discuss three of the biggest lessons I’ve learned with regards to attribution—and how researchers can avoid making the same errors.\r\n \r\nThe first mistake is related to perception bias. The Olympic Destroyer was a cyber-sabotage attack that happened during the PyeongChang Winter Olympic in 2018. Many security vendors published information about the substance of the attack alongside unclear speculation about who was ultimately behind it. During the early stage of my Olympic Destroyer research, I strongly believed a North Korea-linked threat actor was behind the attack. Looking back, I’m overwhelmed by my confirmation bias at that time. The relationship between North Korea and South Korea was relatively stable during the Olympics, but North Korea sometimes attacked South Korea regardless. Therefore, I assumed the attack was associated with a North Korean threat actor that wanted to sow chaos during the Olympic season. However, my colleague discovered a fascinating rich header false flag designed to disguise the fact that this attack was carried out by an unrelated threat actor. Also, I confirmed that the threat actor behind this attack utilized a totally different modus operandi than the presumed North Korean threat actor after an in-depth, onsite investigation. I had allowed my perception bias to hinder my attribution efforts.\r\n\r\nThe second mistake occurred as a result of an over-reliance on third-party functions.\r\nResearchers are often inclined to rely on too many third-party tools, and occasionally this blind faith causes mistakes. One day, I discovered that one Korean-speaking threat actor utilized a 0-day exploit embedded in a Word document. Based on the metadata of the malicious document, I used Virustotal to find additional documents with similar metadata. All of them had the same language code page, which made me even more biased. From then, I started going in the wrong direction. I totally believed that those documents were created by the same threat actor. However, I later discovered that the documents were created by two different actors with very similar characteristics. Both of them are Korean-speaking actors, who, historically, attack the same target. Eventually, I uncovered the difference between the two and was able to reach the right conclusion—but this required going beyond what my tools told me was the correct answer.\r\n\r\nThe last mistake occurred as a result of impatience. When I investigated one cryptocurrency exchange incident, I noticed that the cryptocurrency trading application was compromised and had been delivered with a malicious file. Without any doubt, I concluded that the supply chain of this company was compromised, and contacted them via email to notify them of this incident. But, as soon as I contacted them, their websites went offline and the application disappeared from the website. After a closer examination of their infrastructure, I recognized that everything was fake, including the company website, application, and 24/7 support team.

We were curious if the same efforts are invested in the operation security of these campaigns.\nWe started a journey researching active campaigns from the Middle East to the Far East including the Palestinian Authority, Turkey, and Iran, Russia, China, and North Korea. These campaigns were both state-sponsored, surveillance-targeted attacks and large-scale financially-motivated attacks.\nWe analyzed every technology used throughout the attack chain: Windows (Go-lang/.Net/Delphi) and Android malware; both on Windows and Linux-based C2 servers. \nWe found unbelievable mistakes which allow us to discover new advanced TTPs used by attackers, for example: bypassing iCloud two-factor authentication' and crypto wallet and NFT stealing methods.

We were curious if the same efforts are invested in the operation security of these campaigns.\nWe started a journey researching active campaigns from the Middle East to the Far East including the Palestinian Authority, Turkey, and Iran, Russia, China, and North Korea. These campaigns were both state-sponsored, surveillance-targeted attacks and large-scale financially-motivated attacks.\nWe analyzed every technology used throughout the attack chain: Windows (Go-lang/.Net/Delphi) and Android malware; both on Windows and Linux-based C2 servers. \nWe found unbelievable mistakes which allow us to discover new advanced TTPs used by attackers, for example: bypassing iCloud two-factor authentication' and crypto wallet and NFT stealing methods.

We are gearing up to once again catch Las Vegas with its pants down #pantslessvillage. This year, we return to in-person only operations with up to 5 people per team and table submissions.\r\n\r\nFor those new to DEF CON, or otherwise uninitiated, the DEF CON Scavenger Hunt is regarded by many as the best way to interact with the con. We do our best to encourage you to challenge your comfort zone, meet people, and otherwise see and do a bit of everything that DEF CON 30 has to offer. For those who have aspirations to become more involved with DEF CON in the future, many of our veteran contestants include goons, speakers, and contest organizers.\r\n\r\nSo, how does a scavenger hunt run for 25 years? As this is DEF CON, this is not your ordinary scavenger hunt. The list is open to interpretation, it is a hacker con after all, so hack the list. Because how you interpret the list is entirely out of our hands, we have posted trigger warnings. You will be finding and doing a variety of things, it is up to you to convince the judges whatever you are turning in meets the criteria and is worth the points.\r\n\r\nYou don’t have to devote all of your time to play and have fun, come turn in a couple items and enjoy yourself. If you want to win however, you will have to scavenge as much as you can over the weekend. While the hunt starts on Friday morning, with determination and a lack of sleep, we have seen people start at 2AM on Saturday night and place. Likewise, if you don’t play well with others, we have seen single-players also place. In other words, we work very hard to keep the barrier to entry as low as possible. You don’t need to be some binary reversing wizard, and there’s no qualifier to compete, you can just show up and win if you want it enough.\r\n\r\nThe hunt was started by Pinguino at DEF CON 5 simply to avoid being bored; there was no hunt at DEF CON 8, for those doing math.

We are gearing up to once again catch Las Vegas with its pants down #pantslessvillage. This year, we return to in-person only operations with up to 5 people per team and table submissions.\r\n\r\nFor those new to DEF CON, or otherwise uninitiated, the DEF CON Scavenger Hunt is regarded by many as the best way to interact with the con. We do our best to encourage you to challenge your comfort zone, meet people, and otherwise see and do a bit of everything that DEF CON 30 has to offer. For those who have aspirations to become more involved with DEF CON in the future, many of our veteran contestants include goons, speakers, and contest organizers.\r\n\r\nSo, how does a scavenger hunt run for 25 years? As this is DEF CON, this is not your ordinary scavenger hunt. The list is open to interpretation, it is a hacker con after all, so hack the list. Because how you interpret the list is entirely out of our hands, we have posted trigger warnings. You will be finding and doing a variety of things, it is up to you to convince the judges whatever you are turning in meets the criteria and is worth the points.\r\n\r\nYou don’t have to devote all of your time to play and have fun, come turn in a couple items and enjoy yourself. If you want to win however, you will have to scavenge as much as you can over the weekend. While the hunt starts on Friday morning, with determination and a lack of sleep, we have seen people start at 2AM on Saturday night and place. Likewise, if you don’t play well with others, we have seen single-players also place. In other words, we work very hard to keep the barrier to entry as low as possible. You don’t need to be some binary reversing wizard, and there’s no qualifier to compete, you can just show up and win if you want it enough.\r\n\r\nThe hunt was started by Pinguino at DEF CON 5 simply to avoid being bored; there was no hunt at DEF CON 8, for those doing math. In the intervening years, to further avoid boredom, we have been out scavenging and went from having a simple cardboard sign to a truly mesmerizing table.\r\n\r\nSo come to the scav hunt table in the contest area (it’s hard to miss us) with a team name ready.

Last year, due to the pandemic, the contest was online only with on-site demonstrations. All the challenges were deployed in 3D simulators.  This year, we propose a hybrid event with in-person challenges on-site. We also plan to introduce some new challenges with real vehicles involved, in addition to those based on autonomous driving simulators. We hope to continue the engagement with the hacking community to raise the awareness of real-world security challenges in autonomous driving.\r\n\r\nThe AutoDriving CTF contest focuses on the emerging security challenges in autonomous driving systems. Various levels of self-driving functionalities, such as AI-powered perception, sensor fusion and route planning, are entering the product portfolio of automobile companies. From the security perspective, these AI-powered components not only contain common security problems such as memory safety bugs, but also introduce new threats such as physical adversarial attacks and sensor manipulations. Two popular examples of physical adversarial attacks are camouflage stickers that interfere with vehicle detection systems, and road graffitis that disturb lane keeping systems. The AI-powered navigation and control relies on the fusion of multiple sensor inputs, and many of the sensor inputs can be manipulated by malicious attackers. These manipulations combined with logical bugs in autonomous driving systems pose severe threats to road safety.\r\n\r\nWe design autonomous driving CTF (AutoDriving CTF) contests around the security challenges specific to these self-driving functions and components.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the AutoDriving CTF are the followings:\r\n\r\n- Demonstrate security risks of poorly designed autonomous driving systems through hands-on challenges, increase the awareness of such risks in security professionals, and encourage them to propose defense solutions and tools to detect such risks.\r\n- Provide CTF challenges that allow players to learn attack and defense practices related to autonomous driving in a well-controlled, repeatable, and visible environment.\r\n- Build a set of vulnerable autonomous driving components that can be used for security research and defense evaluation.\r\n\r\nThe contest is based on a Jeopardy style of CTF game with a set of independent challenges. A typical contest challenge includes a backend that runs autonomous driving components in simulated or real environments, and a frontend that interacts with the players. This year's contest will follow the style of last year and includes the following types of challenges:\r\n- “attack”: such as constructing adversarial patches and spoofing fake sensor inputs,\r\n- “forensics”: such as investigating a security incident related to autonomous driving,\r\n- “detection”: such as detecting spoofed sensor inputs and fake obstacles,\r\n- “crashme on road!”: such as creating dangerous traffic patterns to expose logical errors in autonomous driving systems.\r\n\r\nMost of these challenges will be developed using game-engine based autonomous driving simulators, such as CARLA and SVL. \r\nThe following link containssome challenge videos from AutoDriving CTF at DEF CON 29\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPPsKbVpxwk-464KIzr8xKw\r\n\r\nWhat's new in 2022\r\n\r\nThis year, we will unlock new security-critical driving scenarios such as stop-controlled and signalized intersections. New difficulty levels will be added to challenges in such scenarios by integrating real downstream AI modules such as object tracking from open-source autonomous driving software like Apollo, Autoware and OpenPilot. For example, players will be required to generate adversarial masks which will be overlayed on the surface of a stop sign to prevent the self-driving vehicle from stopping. The self-driving vehicle is equipped with a tracking component so merely hiding the stop sign in several frames will not work.\r\n\r\nA video demonstrating an attacked scenario is available at\r\nhttps://youtu.be/4aedG1GNfRw\r\n\r\nIn addition to the simulation challenges, we will add challenges with real vehicles in the loop. In this setup, the vehicle under attack will be placed on a rack and the driving environment will be displayed on a monitor in front of the windshield camera. We will have the real vehicle running in a lab and players and players will interact with the vehicle by remotely manipulating the virtual surrounding environments (such as the projected road signs in front of the vehicle).  The attack results will be judged based on systems logs (for open-source systems, such as openpilot) or dashboard visualizations (for closed-source vehicles).\r\n\r\nThe following URL shows some specifications about the real vehicles\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1oFC5Swn-UQ3hqIBA_Pw511o8WZqToU4TcQCb3UYocFc/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nIn order to enable the audience to experience the challenges more directly, we plan to set up a vehicle wheel controller on site this year. Audiences can drive themselves to compete with the self-driving vehicle in some of the challenges.\r\n\r\nFor players\r\n\r\n- What do players need to do to participate AutoDriving CTF?\r\nMost of the challenges do not require domain knowledge of autonomous driving software or adversarial machine learning, although knowledge of those helps. For example, the players can generate images the way they like (e.g., drawing, photoshopping) to fool the AI-components or write a short python script to control the vehicle. Some challenges, such as incident forensics likely would require players to learn domain knowledge such as sensor information format and how fusion works.\r\n\r\n- What do we expect players to learn through the CTF event?\r\nPlayers can (1) gain a deep understanding of real-world autonomous driving systems' design, implementation, and their corresponding security properties and characteristics; and (2) learn the attack and defense practices related to autonomous driving in a well-controlled, repeatable, visible, and engaging environment.\r\n\r\nAdditional information\r\n\r\nBelow are some materials from our first AutoDriving CTF at DEF CON 29 in 2021, which includes some challenge videos (Warning: the videos files could be large in google drive), a summary of the event and some links reporting the events.\r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cr3qlX1mC7vGPzqqEZ900ZDiEQdbzGo4?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nhttp://www.buffalo.edu/ubnow/stories/2021/11/team-cacti-capture-flag.html\r\n\r\nhttps://medium.com/@asguard.research/invisible-truck-gps-hacking-mad-racing-first-person-view-of-worlds-first-ever-autonomous-9b2d5903672a\r\n\r\nhttps://netsec.ccert.edu.cn/eng/hacking/2021-08-06-autodrive-defcon\r\n\r\nhttps://cactilab.github.io/ctf.html\n\n\n","title":"AutoDriving CTF","type":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","color":"#cf74e1","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","name":"Contest","id":45360},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1660406400,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Overview\r\n\r\nLast year, we organized the AutoDriving CTF as an official contest of DEF CON 29 (https://forum.defcon.org/node/237292) and did reasonably well: more than 100 teams participated and 93 teams had valid scores.

Some challenges, such as incident forensics likely would require players to learn domain knowledge such as sensor information format and how fusion works.\r\n\r\n- What do we expect players to learn through the CTF event?\r\nPlayers can (1) gain a deep understanding of real-world autonomous driving systems' design, implementation, and their corresponding security properties and characteristics; and (2) learn the attack and defense practices related to autonomous driving in a well-controlled, repeatable, visible, and engaging environment.\r\n\r\nAdditional information\r\n\r\nBelow are some materials from our first AutoDriving CTF at DEF CON 29 in 2021, which includes some challenge videos (Warning: the videos files could be large in google drive), a summary of the event and some links reporting the events.\r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cr3qlX1mC7vGPzqqEZ900ZDiEQdbzGo4?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nhttp://www.buffalo.edu/ubnow/stories/2021/11/team-cacti-capture-flag.html\r\n\r\nhttps://medium.com/@asguard.research/invisible-truck-gps-hacking-mad-racing-first-person-view-of-worlds-first-ever-autonomous-9b2d5903672a\r\n\r\nhttps://netsec.ccert.edu.cn/eng/hacking/2021-08-06-autodrive-defcon\r\n\r\nhttps://cactilab.github.io/ctf.html","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1659666300,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"timeband_id":891,"links":[{"label":"Twitter","type":"link","url":"https://twitter.com/autodrivingctf"},{"label":"Discord","type":"link","url":"https://discord.com/channels/708208267699945503/864186660107059230"},{"label":"DEF CON Forum","type":"link","url":"https://forum.defcon.org/node/241379"},{"label":"Website","type":"link","url":"https://autodrivingctf.org/"}],"end":"2022-08-13T16:00:00.000-0000","id":49569,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45360,45375,45450],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660320000,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"Y","location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45436,"name":"Caesars Forum - Summit 206-208, 238, 237, 234 (Contest Area)","hotel":"","short_name":"206-208, 238, 237, 234 (Contest Area)","id":45468},"begin":"2022-08-12T16:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2022-08-05T02:25:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Try yourself in ATM, Online bank, POS and Cards hacking challenges.\r\n\r\nPlease join the DEF CON Discord and see the #payv-labs-text channel for more information. \n\n\n","title":"Payment Hacking Challenge","type":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","color":"#cad46b","name":"Payment Village","id":45380},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1660338000,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Try yourself in ATM, Online bank, POS and Cards hacking challenges.\r\n\r\nPlease join the DEF CON Discord and see the #payv-labs-text channel for more information.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1660259820,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"timeband_id":891,"end":"2022-08-12T21:00:00.000-0000","links":[{"label":"Discord #payv-labs-text","type":"link","url":"https://discord.com/channels/708208267699945503/732733473558626314"}],"id":49560,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660320000,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[40263,45366,45374,45380],"village_id":21,"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"Challenge","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45476,"name":"Virtual - Payment Village","hotel":"","short_name":"Payment Village","id":45414},"spans_timebands":"N","updated":"2022-08-11T23:17:00.000-0000","begin":"2022-08-12T16:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"In this competition, teams go toe to toe by placing live vishing (voice phishing) phone calls in front of the Social Engineering Community audience at DEF CON.

Are you new to investigation or want to take your analysis to the next level? If you answered yes, here is your chance to experience an exciting 4-hour class taught by mR_F0r3n51c5 and S3curityNerd. In today's threat landscape, malware continues to be used by all various types of threat actors. This class teaches students how to investigate a compromised Windows system using forensic and malware analysis fundamentals.\n\nUpon successful class completion, students will be able to:\n- Build analysis skills that leverage complex scenarios and improve comprehension.\n- Practically acquire data in a forensically sound manner.\n- Identify common areas of malware persistence.\n- Gather evidence and create a timeline to characterize how the system was compromised.\n- Participate in a hand to keyboard combat capstone. Students are given an image of a compromised Windows system and demonstrate how to analyze it.\n\nMaterials:\nStudents will be required to download a virtual machine (OVA file). Students will be given a URL for download access. \nRegarding the downloaded virtual machine, this will be imported into your virtual machine software and ready before the start of class. If any additional technical support is needed, the instructors will make themselves available online. \nStudents must have a laptop that meets the following requirements:\nA 64 bit CPU running at 2GHz or more. The students will be running a virtual machine on their host laptop.\nHave the ability to update BIOS settings. Specifically, enable virtualization technology such as \"Intel-VT.\"\nThe student must be able to access their system's BIOS if it is password protected.

Are you new to investigation or want to take your analysis to the next level? If you answered yes, here is your chance to experience an exciting 4-hour class taught by mR_F0r3n51c5 and S3curityNerd. In today's threat landscape, malware continues to be used by all various types of threat actors. This class teaches students how to investigate a compromised Windows system using forensic and malware analysis fundamentals.\n\nUpon successful class completion, students will be able to:\n- Build analysis skills that leverage complex scenarios and improve comprehension.\n- Practically acquire data in a forensically sound manner.\n- Identify common areas of malware persistence.\n- Gather evidence and create a timeline to characterize how the system was compromised.\n- Participate in a hand to keyboard combat capstone. Students are given an image of a compromised Windows system and demonstrate how to analyze it.\n\nMaterials:\nStudents will be required to download a virtual machine (OVA file). Students will be given a URL for download access. \nRegarding the downloaded virtual machine, this will be imported into your virtual machine software and ready before the start of class. If any additional technical support is needed, the instructors will make themselves available online. \nStudents must have a laptop that meets the following requirements:\nA 64 bit CPU running at 2GHz or more. The students will be running a virtual machine on their host laptop.\nHave the ability to update BIOS settings. Specifically, enable virtualization technology such as \"Intel-VT.\"\nThe student must be able to access their system's BIOS if it is password protected. This is in case of changes being necessary.\n8 GB (Gigabytes) of RAM or higher\nAt least one open and working USB Type-A port\n50 Gigabytes of free hard drive space, allowing you the ability to host the VMs we distribute\nStudents must have Local Administrator Access on their system. \nWireless 802.11 Capability\nA host operating system that is running Windows 10+, Linux, or macOS 10.4 or later.\nVirtualization software is required.

All together, this workshop aims to give you the tools you need to start attacking systems at the network layer.\n\nMaterials:\nA laptop with Linux or a Linux VM (MacOS can also work, but have a VM installed as a backup).\nThese software tools (detailed installation instructions will be provided in the materials ahead of DEFCON):\n        - OpenVPN: Connect to the challenges you will be hacking\n        - Wireshark (tcpdump also works): Capture and dissect network traffic\n        - netcat (nc): Swiss-army-knife of networking\n        - nmap: Scan and search for vulnerable targets\n        - bettercap: Man-in-the-middle attack tool and network attack platform\n        - python3 (optional): Build new attack tools\n\nPrereq:\nBasic experience with Linux command-line tools\n\nBasic familiarity with networking (e.g. you know what IP and MAC addresses are, you could set up your home router, and host a LAN party)","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1659157980,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[49112],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49169],"name":"Ben Kurtz","affiliations":[{"organization":"","title":"Hacker"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":48551,"title":"Hacker"},{"content_ids":[49112],"conference_id":65,"event_ids":[49169],"name":"Victor Graf","affiliations":[{"organization":"","title":"Hacker"}],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":48585,"title":"Hacker"}],"timeband_id":890,"links":[],"end":"2022-08-11T20:00:00.000-0000","id":49169,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[45336,45343,45373,45452],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1660233600,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48551},{"tag_id":565,"sort_order":1,"person_id":48585}],"tags":"","conference_id":65,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":65,"conference":"DEFCON30","updated_at":"2024-06-07T03:39+0000","parent_id":45439,"name":"Harrah's - Ely (Workshops)","hotel":"","short_name":"Ely (Workshops)","id":45486},"spans_timebands":"N","updated":"2022-07-30T05:13:00.000-0000","begin":"2022-08-11T16:00:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"DEFCON30","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Let's break out Wireshark and dig deep in to the TCP and IP protocols.
