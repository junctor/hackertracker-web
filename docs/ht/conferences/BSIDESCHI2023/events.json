We categorize the artifacts into inbound (destination system artifacts) and outbound (source system artifacts) access, making it easier to identify the type of access. Additionally, we introduce a new Windows lateral movement Velociraptor plugin that provides a better, data-rich, and contextual view of lateral movement. This plugin builds on the existing Windows.Packs.LateralMovement hunt by adding more data such as the time, source host, destination host, and application while supporting a more diverse set of artifacts such as Windows UAL, Shellbags, Windows Registry ,and application configuration files. Finally, we will also cover how to efficiently consume the output generated by this plugin through tools that support data visualizations. The plugin will benefit DFIR community as the investigators will have a variety of lateral movement artifacts at a single place, normalized results from multiple output formats, and a process to visualize those results.\r\n\n\n\n","title":"Tracing the Footsteps: A Bird’s Eye View of Lateral Movement Using Velociraptor","type":{"conference_id":128,"conference":"BSIDESCHI2023","updated_at":"2023-11-08T21:33+0000","color":"#116F72","name":"Talk","id":46066},"android_description":"1.

We categorize the artifacts into inbound (destination system artifacts) and outbound (source system artifacts) access, making it easier to identify the type of access. Additionally, we introduce a new Windows lateral movement Velociraptor plugin that provides a better, data-rich, and contextual view of lateral movement. This plugin builds on the existing Windows.Packs.LateralMovement hunt by adding more data such as the time, source host, destination host, and application while supporting a more diverse set of artifacts such as Windows UAL, Shellbags, Windows Registry ,and application configuration files. Finally, we will also cover how to efficiently consume the output generated by this plugin through tools that support data visualizations. The plugin will benefit DFIR community as the investigators will have a variety of lateral movement artifacts at a single place, normalized results from multiple output formats, and a process to visualize those results.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1699649100,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1699399800,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"conference_id":128,"event_ids":[53343,53344],"name":"Phalgun Kulkarni","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":52171}],"timeband_id":1137,"links":[],"end":"2023-11-10T20:45:00.000-0000","id":53344,"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[46066],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1699646400,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46067,"sort_order":1,"person_id":52171}],"tags":"","conference_id":128,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":128,"conference":"BSIDESCHI2023","updated_at":"2023-11-08T21:33+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"Track 2","hotel":"","short_name":"Track 2","id":46086},"begin":"2023-11-10T20:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-11-07T23:30:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESCHI2023","timezone":"America/Chicago","link":"","description":"We are pleased to be back for the return of Bsides to Chicago.

In one of the sections , we will demonstrate how internal repositories like GitHub can lead to obtaining privileged access into GCP by exploiting IAM attack vectors. Additionally, we will discus how environments like GCP and G Suite are connected by domain wide delegation and how attackers are capable of laterally moving into G Suite and obtaining super admin access. Next we are going to talk about the interconnectivity between different environments. A lot of organizations believe that cloud environments are segregated from their internal networks and their Active Directory environment. We will demonstrate that the on-premise and cloud environments are all inter-connected and how attackers can pivot between environments to escalate privileged on Cloud and AD environments. Lastly, we are going to talk about what organizations should be aware when setting up hybrid environments with DevOps pipelines to protect from insider threat actors.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1699634700,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1699399800,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"conference_id":128,"event_ids":[53347],"name":"Alex Bui","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":52151},{"conference_id":128,"event_ids":[53347],"name":"Marios Gyftos","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":52167},{"conference_id":128,"event_ids":[53347],"name":"Paul Hissem","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":52170},{"conference_id":128,"event_ids":[53347],"name":"Trenton Givens","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":52176}],"timeband_id":1137,"links":[],"end":"2023-11-10T16:45:00.000-0000","id":53347,"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1699632000,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[46066],"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46067,"sort_order":1,"person_id":52151},{"tag_id":46067,"sort_order":1,"person_id":52167},{"tag_id":46067,"sort_order":1,"person_id":52170},{"tag_id":46067,"sort_order":1,"person_id":52176}],"tags":"","conference_id":128,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":128,"conference":"BSIDESCHI2023","updated_at":"2023-11-08T21:33+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"Track 4","hotel":"","short_name":"Track 4","id":46088},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2023-11-10T16:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-11-07T23:30:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESCHI2023","timezone":"America/Chicago","link":"","description":"Outline: \r\n\r\n1.
