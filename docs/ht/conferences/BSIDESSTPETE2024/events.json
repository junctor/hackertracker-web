We will present actionable results from two experiments untaken in this case study: the first to understand the abilities of individuals receiving training to identify human-made versus AI-made training modules; the second to identify the most critical skills training creators need to possess in order to best leverage ChatGPT as an aid in training module development. Going beyond the precepts of verifying Generative AI output, we provide an outline for how to build your cybersecurity awareness teams to maximize the effectiveness of using Generative AI as part of your broader strategy to create, deliver, and keep fresh and relevant your training program. We will provide a workflow for how to prepare your cybersecurity personnel and organization to most effectively and inclusively innovate and iterate on this critical piece of human-facing cybersecurity practice, and inspire a new generation to get involved in this crucial task.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1724809225,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"content_ids":[56486],"conference_id":161,"event_ids":[57158],"name":"Brian Callahan","updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","affiliations":[{"organization":"Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute","title":"Graduate Program Director and Senior Lecturer in the Information Technology and Web Science program"}],"pronouns":null,"links":[{"description":"","title":"LinkedIn","sort_order":0,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-robert-callahan-ph-d-cissp-707738137/"},{"description":"","title":"Website","sort_order":0,"url":"https://briancallahan.net"}],"media":[{"hash_sha256":"460307266bea82f4d5c23a5469e9a71bc30c189dca11ba745583115d64701e16","filetype":"image/jpeg","hash_md5":"c3b0e9c1902d552cfdc91778b50f14bd","name":"p_BrianCallahan.jpg","hash_crc32c":"abb8b2e1","asset_id":995,"filesize":101144,"sort_order":1,"url":"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/junctor-hackertracker.appspot.com/o/BSIDESSTPETE2024%2Fp_BrianCallahan.jpg?alt=media","person_id":56802}],"id":56802,"title":"Graduate Program Director and Senior Lecturer in the Information Technology and Web Science program at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"},{"content_ids":[56486],"conference_id":161,"event_ids":[57158],"name":"Quinn Colognato","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":56803},{"content_ids":[56486],"conference_id":161,"event_ids":[57158],"name":"Mary Cotrupi","affiliations":[],"updated_tsz":"2024-07-21T18:01:02Z","links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":56804}],"begin_tsz":"2024-09-14T13:00:00Z","timeband_id":1244,"updated_tsz":"2024-08-28T01:40:25Z","links":[],"end":"2024-09-14T13:50:00.000-0000","id":57158,"tag_ids":[46955],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1726318800,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46956,"sort_order":2,"person_id":56802},{"tag_id":46956,"sort_order":4,"person_id":56803},{"tag_id":46956,"sort_order":6,"person_id":56804}],"tags":"","conference_id":161,"location":{"parent_id":0,"name":"Room 4","hotel":"","short_name":"Room 4","id":46536},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-09-14T13:00:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-08-28T01:40:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESSTPETE2024","timezone":"America/New_York","link":"","description":"Effective leadership in cybersecurity is not just about technical know-how; it's about shaping the future through strategic influence.
